This is a project that aims to make some of RawTherapee's highly optimized raw
processing routines readily available for other FOSS photo editing software.

The goal is to move certain source files from RawTherapee into this library.
Thus, any changes to the source can be done here and will be used by the
projects which use librtprocess.
