JPEG XR is an approved ISO/IEC International standard (its official designation
is ISO/IEC 29199-2).

JPEG XR started its life in Microsoft Research. It publicly first appeared
as the HD Photo format in Windows Vista.

For web developers, JPEG XR has a large number of interesting features, see
the table below. Some of these are big advantages over other image formats
like JPEG, PNG, OpenEXR, and TIFF.

- Better Compression (40% smaller than JPEG)
- Lossless Mode (better compression than PNG)
- Alpha Channel (compress color lossy and alpha losslessly)
- Extended Bitdepth (supports 8/16/32-bit channels)
- Progressive Decode
- Advanced Decoding Features (tile-based layout, for efficient
  region-of-interest access)
