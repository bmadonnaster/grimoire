Spiro is the creation of Raph Levien. It simplifies the drawing of beautiful
curves.

Using bézier splines an artist can easily draw curves with the same slope
on either side of an on-curve point. Spiros, on the other hand, are based
on clothoid splines which make it easy to maintain constant curvature as
well as constant slope. Such curves will simply look nicer.

Raph Levien's spiro splines only use on-curve points and so are easier to
use and more intuitive to the artist.

This library will take an array of spiro control points and convert them
into a series of bézier splines which can then be used in the myriad of
ways the world has come to use béziers.
