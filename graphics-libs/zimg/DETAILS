cat << EOF
The zimg library implements the commonly required image processing basics of
scaling, colorspace conversion, and depth conversion. A simple API enables
conversion between any supported formats to operate with minimal knowledge from
the programmer. All library routines were designed from the ground-up with
correctness, flexibility, and thread-safety as first priorities. Allocation,
buffering, and I/O are cleanly separated from processing, allowing the
programmer to adapt zimg to many scenarios.
