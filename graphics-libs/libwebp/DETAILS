WebP is a new image format that provides lossless and lossy compression for 
images on the web. WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to 
PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller in size compared to JPEG images at 
equivalent SSIM index. WebP supports lossless transparency (also known as 
alpha channel) with just 22% additional bytes. Transparency is also supported 
with lossy compression and typically provides 3x smaller file sizes compared 
to PNG when lossy compression is acceptable for the red/green/blue color 
channels.
