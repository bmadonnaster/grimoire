SFML is a portable and easy to use multimedia API written in C++. You can
see it as a modern, object-oriented alternative to SDL.

SFML is composed of several packages to perfectly suit your needs. You can
use SFML as a minimal windowing system to interface with OpenGL, or as a
fully-featured multimedia library for building games or interactive programs.
