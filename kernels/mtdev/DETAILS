cat << EOF
The mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of kernel MT events 
to the slotted type B protocol. The events put into mtdev may be from any MT device, 
specifically type A without contact tracking, type A with contact tracking, or type B 
with contact tracking. See the kernel documentation for further details. 
The bulk of the mtdev code has been out there since 2008, as part of the Multitouch X 
Driver. With this package, finger tracking and seamless MT protocol handling is 
available under a free license.
