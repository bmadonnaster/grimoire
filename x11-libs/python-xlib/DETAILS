The Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X client library
for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in contrast to earlier
X libraries for Python (the ancient X extension and the newer plxlib) which
were interfaces to the C Xlib.

This is possible to do since X client programs communicate with the X server
via the X protocol. The communication takes place over TCP/IP, Unix sockets,
DECnet or any other suitable streaming network protocol. The C Xlib is merely
an interface to this protocol, providing functions suited for a C environment.

There are three advantages of choosing to implement a pure Python library:

*Integration: The library can make use of the wonderful object system in
Python, providing an easy-to-use class hierarchy.
* Portability: The library will be usable on (almost) any computer which
have Python installed. A C interface could be problematic to port to non-Unix
systems, such as MS Windows or OpenVMS.
* Maintainability: It is much easier to develop and debug native Python
modules than modules written in C.
