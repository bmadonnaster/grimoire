cat << EOF
This library provides the ability to launch and interact with external
processes. It wraps around the process library, and intends to improve upon
it by:

 1. Using type variables to represent the standard streams, making them easier
    to manipulate
 2. Use proper concurrency (e.g., the async library) in place of the weird lazy
    I/O tricks for such things as consuming output streams
 3. Allow for more complex concurrency by providing STM-based functions
 4. Using binary I/O correctly 5. Providing a more composable API, designed
 to be easy to use for both simple
    and complex use cases
