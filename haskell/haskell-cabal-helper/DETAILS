cat << EOF
Cabal's little helper provides access to build information gathered by cabal
when configuring a project. Specifically we're interested in retrieving
enough information to bring up a compiler session, using the GHC API, which
is similar to running cabal repl in a project.

While simple in principle this is complicated by the fact that the information
Cabal writes to disk is in an unstable format and only really accessible
through the Cabal API itself.
