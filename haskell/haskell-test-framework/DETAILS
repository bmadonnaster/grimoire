cat << EOF
Allows tests such as QuickCheck properties and HUnit test cases to be
assembled into test groups, run in parallel (but reported in deterministic
order, to aid diff interpretation) and filtered and controlled by command
line options. All of this comes with colored test output, progress reporting
and test statistics output.
