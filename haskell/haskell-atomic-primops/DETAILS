cat << EOF
After GHC 7.4 a new casMutVar# primop became available, but it's difficult to
use safely, because pointer equality is a highly unstable property in Haskell.
This library provides a safer method based on the concept of Tickets.

Also, this library uses the "foreign primop" capability of GHC to add access
to other variants that may be of interest, specifically, compare and swap
inside an array.

Note that as of GHC 7.8, the relevant primops have been included in GHC itself.
This library is engineered to work pre- and post-GHC-7.8, while exposing
the same interface.
