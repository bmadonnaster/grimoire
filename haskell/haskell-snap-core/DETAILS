cat << EOF
Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written
in Haskell.

This library contains the core definitions and types for the Snap framework,
including:

1. Primitive types and functions for HTTP (requests, responses, cookies,
post/query parameters, etc) 2. Type aliases and helper functions for Iteratee
I/O 3. A monad for programming web handlers called "Snap", which allows:
    * Stateful access to the HTTP request and response objects * Monadic
    failure (i.e. MonadPlus/Alternative instances) for declining to
      handle requests and chaining handlers together
    * Early termination of the computation if you know early what you want to
      return and want to prevent further monadic processing
