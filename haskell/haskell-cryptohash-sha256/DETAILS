cat << EOF
A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the SHA-256 cryptographic
hash algorithm according to FIPS 180-4 with performance close to the fastest
implementations available in other languages.

The core SHA-256 algorithm is implemented in C and is thus expected to be
as fast as the standard sha256sum(1) tool; for instance, on an Intel Core
i7-3770 at 3.40GHz this implementation can compute a SHA-256 hash over 230
MiB of data in under one second. (If, instead, you require a pure Haskell
implementation and performance is secondary, please refer to the SHA package.)

Additionally, this package provides support for

 * HMAC-SHA-256: SHA-256-based Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC)
 * HKDF-SHA-256: HMAC-SHA-256-based Key Derivation Function (HKDF)

conforming to RFC6234, RFC4231, RFC5869, et al..
