cat << EOF
convertible provides a typeclass with a single function that is designed to
help convert between different types: numeric values, dates and times, and the
like. The conversions perform bounds checking and return a pure Either value.
This means that you need not remember which specific function performs the
conversion you desire.

Also included in the package are optional instances that provide conversion
for various numeric and time types, as well as utilities for writing your
own instances.

Finally, there is a function that will raise an exception on bounds-checking
violation, or return a bare value otherwise, implemented in terms of the
safer function described above.
