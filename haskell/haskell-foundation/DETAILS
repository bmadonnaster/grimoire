cat << EOF
A custom prelude with no dependencies apart from base.

This package has the following goals:

 * provide a base like sets of modules that provide a consistent set of
 features
   and bugfixes across multiple versions of GHC (unlike base).
 * provide a better and more efficient prelude than base's prelude.  * be
 self-sufficient: no external dependencies apart from base.  * provide better
 data-types: packed unicode string by default, arrays.  * Better numerical
 classes that better represent mathematical thing (No more all-in-one Num).
 * Better I/O system with less Lazy IO * Usual partial functions distinguished
 through type system
