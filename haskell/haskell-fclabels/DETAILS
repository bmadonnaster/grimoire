cat << EOF
This package provides first class labels that can act as bidirectional
record fields. The labels can be derived automatically using Template Haskell
which means you don't have to write any boilerplate yourself. The labels are
implemented as lenses and are fully composable. Lenses can be used to get,
set and modify parts of a data type in a consistent way.
