Khph is a tool for managing collections of files from the command line.  It
allows you to tag files via links, and query your collection with a simple
query language.

Khph is for when you just want to tag your recent trip's photos, without
worrying about what all-in-one program to use, or how it stores its metadata.
With khph, the file system is the database.
