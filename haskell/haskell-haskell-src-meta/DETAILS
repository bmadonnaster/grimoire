cat << EOF
haskell-src-meta is a package originally by Matt Morrow for converting a parsed
AST from haskell-src-exts to a TH AST for use in splices and quasiquoters. The
last version Matt released before he disappeared from the Haskell community
was 0.0.6, but by that time his library was already popular, so some community
members eventually decided to take over maintenance of the package, keeping
it up to date with the latest versions of TH etc.
