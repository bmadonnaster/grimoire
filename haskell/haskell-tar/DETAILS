cat << EOF
This library is for working with "@.tar@" archive files. It can read and
write a range of common variations of archive format including V7, USTAR,
POSIX and GNU formats. It provides support for packing and unpacking portable
archives. This makes it suitable for distribution but not backup because
details like file ownership and exact permissions are not preserved.
