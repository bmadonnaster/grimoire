           SHORT="a library for querying and setting echo status"
cat << EOF
The base library exposes the hGetEcho and hSetEcho functions for querying and
setting echo status, but unfortunately, neither function works with MinTTY
consoles on Windows. This is a serious issue, since hGetEcho and hSetEcho are
often used to disable input echoing when a program prompts for a password,
so many programs will reveal your password as you type it on MinTTY!

This library provides an alternative interface which works with both MinTTY
and other consoles. An example is included which demonstrates how one might
prompt for a password using this library.
