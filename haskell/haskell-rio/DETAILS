Please enter a description of the spell here While GHC ships with a base
library, as well as a number of other common packages like directory and
transformers, there are large gaps in functionality provided by these
libraries. This choice for a more minimalistic base is by design, but it
leads to some unfortunate consequences:

  * For a given task, it's often unclear which is the right library to use *
  When writing libraries, there is often concern about adding dependencies to
    any libraries outside of base, due to creating a heavier dependency
    footprint
  * By avoiding adding dependencies, many libraries end up reimplementing the
    same functionality, often with incompatible types and type classes,
    leading to difficulty using libraries together

This library attempts to define a standard library for Haskell.
