cat << EOF
lifted-base exports IO operations from the base library lifted to any instance
of MonadBase or MonadBaseControl.

Note that not all modules from base are converted yet. If you need a lifted
version of a function from base, just ask me to add it or send me a patch.

The package includes a copy of the monad-peel testsuite written by Anders
Kaseorg.  The tests can be performed using cabal test.
