cat << EOF
Lets multiple threads and external processes concurrently output to the
console, without it getting all garbled up.

Built on top of that is a way of defining multiple output regions, which
are automatically laid out on the screen and can be individually updated by
concurrent threads. Can be used for progress displays etc.
