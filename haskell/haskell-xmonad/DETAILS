cat << EOF
Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell. Windows
are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically
reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to maximise the use of
screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely
from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in
Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in
config files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user should know
in advance precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action.
