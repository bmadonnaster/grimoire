cat << EOF
D-Bus is a simple, message-based protocol for inter-process communication,
which allows applications to interact with other parts of the machine and
the user's session using remote procedure calls.

D-Bus is a essential part of the modern Linux desktop, where it replaces
earlier protocols such as CORBA and DCOP.

This library is an implementation of the D-Bus protocol in Haskell. It can
be used to add D-Bus support to Haskell applications, without the awkward
interfaces common to foreign bindings.
