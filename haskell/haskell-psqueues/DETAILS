cat << EOF
The psqueues package provides Priority Search Queues in three different
flavors.

* OrdPSQ k p v, which uses the Ord k instance to provide fast insertion,
  deletion and lookup. This implementation is based on Ralf Hinze's A Simple
  Implementation Technique for Priority Search Queues. Hence, it is similar
  to the PSQueue library, although it is considerably faster and provides
  a slightly different API.
* IntPSQ p v is a far more efficient implementation. It fixes the key type to
  Int and uses a radix tree (like IntMap) with an additional min-heap property.
* HashPSQ k p v is a fairly straightforward extension of IntPSQ: it simply
  uses the keys' hashes as indices in the IntPSQ. If there are any hash
  collisions, it uses an OrdPSQ to resolve those. The performance of this
  implementation is comparable to that of IntPSQ, but it is more widely
  applicable since the keys are not restricted to Int, but rather to any
  Hashable datatype.

Each of the three implementations provides the same API, so they can be
used interchangeably.
