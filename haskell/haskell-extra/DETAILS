cat << EOF
A library of extra functions for the standard Haskell libraries. Most
functions are simple additions, filling out missing functionality. A few
functions are available in later versions of GHC, but this package makes
them available back to GHC 7.2.

The module Extra documents all functions provided by this library. Modules
such as Data.List.Extra provide extra functions over Data.List and also
reexport Data.List. Users are recommended to replace Data.List imports with
Data.List.Extra if they need the extra functionality.
