The hackage security library provides both server and client utilities for
securing the Hackage package server (http://hackage.haskell.org/). It is
based on The Update Framework (http://theupdateframework.com/), a set of
recommendations developed by security researchers at various universities in
the US as well as developers on the Tor project (https://www.torproject.org/).
