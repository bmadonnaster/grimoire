cat << EOF
esqueleto is a bare bones, type-safe EDSL for SQL queries that works with
unmodified persistent SQL backends. Its language closely resembles SQL, so
you don't have to learn new concepts, just new syntax, and it's fairly easy
to predict the generated SQL and optimize it for your backend. Most kinds of
errors committed when writing SQL are caught as compile-time errors---although
it is possible to write type-checked esqueleto queries that fail at runtime.
