TurboVNC is a derivative of VNC (Virtual Network Computing) that is tuned to
provide peak performance for 3D and video workloads.

TurboVNC was originally a fork of TightVNC 1.3.x.

The current version of TurboVNC contains a much more modern X server code base
(based on X.org 7.7) and a variety of other features and fixes not present in
TightVNC, including a high-performance Java viewer. In addition, TurboVNC
compresses 3D and video workloads significantly better than the “tightest”
compression mode in TightVNC 1.3.x while using only typically 15-20% of the
CPU time of the latter. Using non-default settings, TurboVNC can also match
the best compression ratios produced by TightVNC 1.3.x for 2D workloads.
Furthermore, TurboVNC contains some unique features that are designed
specifically for visualization applications.
