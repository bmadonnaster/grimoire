cat << EOF
tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but should
also work with other window managers.

The goal is to keep tint2 unintrusive and light (memory / cpu / aestetic). We
follow freedesktop specifications. We also try to get 'virtual desktop' and
'multi-monitor' easier to use.
