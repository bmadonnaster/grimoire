LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that often works
much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method) and goes through many
configurations of packet-filters (firewalls). More importantly, LFT implements
numerous other features including AS number lookups through several reliable
sources, loose source routing, netblock name lookups, et al.

LFT is the all-in-one traceroute tool because it can launch a variety of
different probes using ICMP, UDP, and TCP protocols, or the RFC1393 trace
method. For example, rather than only launching UDP probes in an attempt to
elicit ICMP "TTL exceeded" from hosts in the path, LFT can send TCP SYN or FIN
probes to target arbitrary services. Then, LFT listens for "TTL exceeded"
messages, TCP RST (reset), and various other interesting heuristics from
firewalls or other gateways in the path. LFT also distinguishes between
TCP-based protocols (source and destination), which make its statistics slightly
more realistic, and gives a savvy user the ability to trace protocol routes,
not just layer-3 (IP) hops.

WhoB is a likable whois client (see whois(1)) designed to provide everything a
network engineer needs to know about a routed IP address by typing one line and
reading one line. It can display the origin-ASN based on the global routing
table at that time (according to Prefix WhoIs, RIPE NCC, or Cymru), the 'origin'
ASN registered in the RADB (IRR), the netname and orgname, etc.
