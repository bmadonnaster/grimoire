tcptrace is a TCP dump file analysis tool written by Shawn Ostermann at Ohio
University. It is NOT a packet capture program. It reads output dump files in
the formats of several popular packet capturing programs: tcpdump, snoop,
etherpeek, and netm.

For each connection, it keeps track of elapsed time, bytes/segments sent and
received, retransmissions, round trip times, window advertisements, throughput,
etc. Its output format ranges from simple to long to very detailed.

It can also produce three different types of graphs: Time Sequence Graph,
Instantaneous Throughput, and Round Trip Times. The graphs produced are viewable
only by the xplot program (in math/xplot).
