iproute2 contains the programs ip, rtmon, and tc. These programs
allow you to specify rules for policy routing and traffic shaping
on Linux machines which are being used as routers. A common usage
would be to prevent upstream bandwidth saturation on asymmetric
links such as cable modems.
The HOWTO on lartc.org provides a decent introduction to
iproute2 and other components of a fully-functional Linux router.
