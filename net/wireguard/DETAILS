cat << EOF
WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and utilizes
state-of-the-art cryptography.

It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while
avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant
than OpenVPN.

WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded
interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

It runs over UDP.
