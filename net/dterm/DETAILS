dterm is a simple terminal emulator, which doesn’t actually emulate any
particular terminal. Mainly, it is designed for use with xterm and friends,
which already do a perfectly good emulation, and therefore don’t need
any special help; dterm simply provides a means by which keystrokes are
forwarded to the serial line, and data forwarded from the serial line appears
on the terminal.
