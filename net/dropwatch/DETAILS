Dropwatch is a project to improve the visibility into the Linux networking
stack. Specifically to improve our ability to detect and understand packets
that get dropped within the stack.

It uses the kernel's dropmonitor netlink family protocol to listen for
dropped packets. This protocol reports the count and exact location in the
source code of each dropped packet, allowing an admin to know precisely
where network traffic is lost.
