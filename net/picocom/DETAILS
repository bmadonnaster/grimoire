As its name suggests, picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation program. It
is, in principle, very much like minicom, only it's "pico" instead of "mini"!

It was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem configuration, testing,
and debugging tool. It has also served (quite well) as a low-tech serial
communications program to allow access to all types of devices that provide
serial consoles. It could also prove useful in many other similar tasks.

It is ideal for embedded systems since its memory footprint is minimal
(approximately 30K, when stripped). Apart from being a handy little tool,
picocom's source distribution includes a simple, easy to use, and thoroughly
documented terminal-management library, which could serve other projects as
well. This library hides the termios(3) calls, and provides a less complex and
safer (though certainly less feature-rich) interface. picocom runs on Linux,
and with no or minor modifications it could run on any Unix-like system with
the termios(3) library.
