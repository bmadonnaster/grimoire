Inadyn is a small and simple DDNS client with HTTPS support, both GnuTLS and
OpenSSL are supported. Inadyn is commonly available in many GNU/Linux
distributions, used in off-the-shelf routers and Internet gateways to automate
the task of keeping your DNS record up to date with any IP address changes from
your ISP.

It can also be used in installations with redundant (backup) connections to the
Internet.
