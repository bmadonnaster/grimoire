Nemesis is a command-line network packet crafting and injection utility for
UNIX-like and Windows systems. Well suited for testing Network Intrusion
Detection Systems, firewalls, IP stacks and a variety of other tasks.

As a command-line driven utility, it is perfect for automation and scripting.

Nemesis can natively craft and inject ARP, DNS, ETHERNET, ICMP, IGMP, IP,
OSPF, RIP, TCP and UDP packets. Using the IP and the Ethernet injection modes,
almost any custom packet can be crafted and injected.
