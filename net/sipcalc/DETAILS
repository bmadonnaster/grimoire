cat << EOF
Sipcalc is a console-based IP subnet calculator with IPv4 and IPv6 support.

Features include:

o IPv4
  - Multiple address and netmask input formats.
  - Retrieving of address information from interfaces.
  - Classfull and CIDR output.
  - Multiple address and netmask output formats (dotted quad, hex, number of
    bits).
  - Output of broadcast address, network class, Cisco wildcard, hosts/range,
    network range.
  - Output of multiple types of bitmaps.
  - Output of a user-defined number of extra networks.
  - Multiple networks input from commandline.
  - Parsing of a newline-separated list of networks from standard input.
  - Ability to "split" a network based on a smaller netmask, now also with
    recursive runs on the generated subnets.
  - DNS resolution.

o IPv6
  - Compressed and expanded input addresses.
  - Compressed and expanded output.
  - Standard IPv6 network output.
  - v4 in v6 output.
  - Reverse DNS address generation.
  - Ability to "split" a network based on a smaller netmask, now also with
    recursive runs on the generated subnets.
  - DNS resolution.
