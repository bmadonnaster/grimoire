Vale is a command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. It's
open-source, fast, and highly customizable.

Vale differs from most writing-related software in a significant way: it
doesn't attempt to teach you how to write; it's a tool for writers. In other
words, Vale focuses on allowing its users to create their own collections
of rules (known as styles) rather providing its own advice.
