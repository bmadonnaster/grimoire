This bundle of tools comprises:

Cfftot1, which translates a Compact Font Format (CFF) font, or a
PostScript-flavored OpenType font, into PostScript Type 1 format. It correctly
handles subroutines and hints; Mmafm (mmafm) and mmpfb , which create instances
of multiple-master fonts (mmafm and mmpfb were previously distributed in their
own package, mminstance); Otfinfo, which reports information about OpenType
fonts, such as the features they support and the contents of their ‘size’
optical size features; Otftotfm, which creates TeX font metrics and encodings
that correspond to a PostScript-flavored OpenType font. It will interpret
glyph positionings, substitutions, and ligatures as far as it is able. You
can say which OpenType features should be activated; T1dotlessj, creates a
Type 1 font whose only character is a dotless j matching the input font’s
design; T1lint, which checks a Type 1 font for correctness; T1reencode, which
replaces a font’s internal encoding with one you specify; and T1testpage,
which creates a PostScript proof for a Type 1 font. It is preliminary software.
