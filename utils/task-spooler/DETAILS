Task spooler is a Unix batch system where the tasks spooled run one after
the other. The amount of jobs to run at once can be set at any time. Each
user in each system has his own job queue. The tasks are run in the correct
context (that of enqueue) from any shell/process, and its output/results can
be easily watched. It is very useful when you know that your commands depend
on a lot of RAM, a lot of disk use, give a lot of output, or for whatever
reason it's better not to run them all at the same time, while you want to
keep your resources busy for maximum benfit. Its interface allows using it
easily in scripts.
