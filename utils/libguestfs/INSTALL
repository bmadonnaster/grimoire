# Special snowflakes like this are dumb:
# *** Using 'make install' is usually a very bad idea.
# *** Use the './run' script instead - see the guestfs-building(1) man page.
# ***
# *** You can override this by setting REALLY_INSTALL=yes, but don't do that.

export REALLY_INSTALL=yes  &&
default_install
