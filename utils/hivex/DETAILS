cat << EOF
Hivex is a library for extracting the contents of Windows Registry "hive" files. It is designed to be secure against buggy or malicious registry files.

Unlike other tools in this area, it doesn't use the textual .REG format, because parsing that is as much trouble as parsing the original binary format. Instead it makes the file available through a C API, and then wraps this API in higher level scripting and GUI tools.

There is a separate program to export the hive as XML (see hivexml(1)), or to navigate the file (see hivexsh(1)). There is also a Perl script to export and merge the file as a textual .REG (regedit) file, see hivexregedit(1).

If you just want to export or modify the Registry of a Windows virtual machine, you should look at virt-win-reg(1).

Hivex is also comes with language bindings for OCaml, Perl, Python and Ruby.
