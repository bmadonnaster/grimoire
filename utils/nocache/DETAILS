cat << EOF
The nocache tool tries to minimize the effect an application has on the Linux
file system cache. This is done by intercepting the open and close system calls
and calling posix_fadvise with the POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED parameter. Because
the library remembers which pages (ie., 4K-blocks of the file) were already
in file system cache when the file was opened, these will not be marked as
"don't need", because other applications might need that, although they are
not actively used (think: hot standby).

Use case: backup processes that should not interfere with the present state
of the cache.
