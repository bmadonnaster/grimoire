fzy is faster and shows better results than other fuzzy finders.

Most other fuzzy matchers sort based on the length of a match. fzy tries to
find the result the user intended. It does this by favouring matches on
consecutive letters and starts of words. This allows matching using acronyms
or different parts of the path.

fzy is designed to be used both as an editor plugin and on the command line.
Rather than clearing the screen, fzy displays its interface directly below the
current cursor position, scrolling the screen if necessary.
