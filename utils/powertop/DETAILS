PowerTOP is a Linux tool that finds the software component(s) that make your
laptop use more power than necessary while it is idle. As of Linux kernel
version 2.6.21, the kernel no longer has a fixed 1000Hz timer tick. This will
(in theory) give a huge power savings because the CPU stays in low power mode
for longer periods of time during system idle.

However... there are many things that can ruin the party, both inside the
kernel and in userspace. PowerTOP combines various sources of information from
the kernel into one convenient screen so that you can see how well your system
is doing, and which components are the biggest problem.

Requirements:
  * For PowerTOP to work best, use a Linux kernel with the tickless idle
    (NO_HZ) feature enabled (version 2.6.21 or later). Currently, only 32-bit
    kernels have support for tickless idle; 64-bit kernels are expected to gain
    this feature in version 2.6.23.

  * PowerTOP works best on a laptop computer, or at least a computer with an
    Intel mobile processor (certain small non-laptop devices also contain a
    mobile processor). When using PowerTOP on a laptop, do so when running on
    battery.
