The haveged project is an attempt to provide an easy-to-use, unpredictable
random number generator based upon an adaptation of the HAVEGE algorithm.

Haveged was created to remedy low-entropy conditions in the Linux
random device that can occur under some workloads, especially on headless
servers.

Current development of haveged is directed towards improving overall
reliability and adaptability while minimizing the barriers to using haveged
for other tasks.
