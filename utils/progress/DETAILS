cat << EOF
This tool can be described as a command that looks for coreutils basic commands
(cp, mv, dd, tar, gzip/gunzip, cat, etc.) currently running on your system and
displays the percentage of copied data. It can also show estimated time and
throughput, and provides a "top-like" mode (monitoring).

Formerly known as cv (Coreutils Viewer).
