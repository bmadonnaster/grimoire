Sysdig is a simple tool for deep system visibility, with native support for
containers.

Sysdig instruments your physical and virtual machines at the OS level by
installing into the Linux kernel and capturing system calls and other OS events.

Sysdig also makes it possible to create trace files for system activity,
similarly to what you can do for networks with tools like tcpdump and Wireshark.

This way, problems can be analyzed at a later time, without losing important
information. Rich system state is stored in the trace files, so that the
captured activity can be put into full context.
