cat << EOF
iotop identifies processes that use high amount of input/output requests
on your machine. It is similar to the well known top utility, but instead
of showing you what consumes CPU the most, it lists processes by their IO
usage. Inspired by iotop Python script from Guillaume Chazarain, rewritten
in C by Vyacheslav Trushkin and improved by Boian Bonev so it runs without
Python at all.
