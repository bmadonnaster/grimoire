Simple NUMA policy support. It consists of a numactl program to run other
programs with a specific NUMA policy and a libnuma shared library ("NUMA API")
to set NUMA policy in applications.

The libnuma binary interface is supposed to stay binary compatible.
Incompatible changes will use new symbol version numbers.

In addition there are various test and utility programs, like numastat to
display NUMA allocation statistics and memhog.
