smenu is a selection filter just like sed is an editing filter.

This tool takes words from standard input or from a file and presents them on
the screen in different layouts in a scrolling window. A cursor that you can
easily move lets you select one or more of them.

Note that the screen is not cleared at the beginning and end of the smenu
execution. The selection window is displayed at the cursor position and the
previous contents of the terminal are not changed or lost.
