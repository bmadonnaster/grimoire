slop (Select Operation) is an application that queries for a selection from the
user and prints the region to stdout. It grabs the mouse and turns it into a
crosshair, lets the user click and drag to make a selection (or click on a
window) while drawing a pretty box around it, then finally prints the
selection's dimensions to stdout.
