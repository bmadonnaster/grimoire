sexpect is another implementation of Expect which is specifically designed for
Shell scripts (sh, bash, ksh, zsh, ...).

sexpect is designed in the client/server model. sexpect spawn PROGRAM
[option].. starts the server (running as a daemon) and runs the specified
PROGRAM in background. Other sexpect sub-commands (send, expect, wait, ...)
communicate to the server as client commands.
