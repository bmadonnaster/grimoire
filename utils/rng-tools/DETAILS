cat << EOF
Daemon to use a Hardware TRNG. The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between
a Hardware TRNG (true random number generator) such as the ones in some
Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets, and the kernel's PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
It tests the data received from the TRNG using the FIPS 140-2 (2002-10-10)
tests to verify that it is indeed random, and feeds the random data to the
kernel entropy pool.
