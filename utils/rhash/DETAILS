RHash (Recursive Hasher) is a console utility for computing and verifying
hash sums of files. It supports CRC32, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, Tiger,
DC++ TTH, BitTorrent BTIH, ED2K, AICH, GOST R 34.11-94, RIPEMD-160, HAS-160,
EDON-R 256/512, Whirlpool and Snefru-128/256 algorithms. Hash sums are used
to ensure and verify integrity of large volumes of data for a long-term
storing or transferring.

Features:
* Can calculate Magnet links.
* Output in a predefined (SFV, BSD-like) or user defined format.
* Ability to process directories recursively.
* Updating of existing hash files (adding sums of files missing in the hash
  file).
* Calculates several hash sums in one pass.
* Portability: the program works the same under Linux, *BSD, or Windows.

RHash is written in pure C, small in size and is distributed under Open
