cat << EOF
Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate
elements normally aggregated in different files, including users, cron jobs,
and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services,
and files. Its simple declarative specification language provides powerful
classing abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while
allowing them to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency and
prerequisite relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.
