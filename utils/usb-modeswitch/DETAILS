USB_ModeSwitch is a small mode switching tool for controlling multiple mode
(flip flop) USB devices.

Several new USB devices (especially high-speed WAN stuff, based on cell phone
chipsets containing that feature) have their MS Windows drivers onboard; when
plugged in for the first time they act like a flash storage and start
installing the driver from there.
After installation (and on every consecutive plugging) the driver switches the
mode internally, the storage device vanishes (in most cases), and a new device
(like an USB modem) shows up. Modem maker "Option" calls that feature "ZeroCD
(TM)" since it eliminates the need for shipping a separate driver carrier.
