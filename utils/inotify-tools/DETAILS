cat << EOF
inotify-tools is a C library and a set of command-line programs for Linux
that provides
a simple interface to inotify.
These programs can be used to monitor and act upon filesystem events.
A more detailed description of the programs is further down the page. The
programs are written in C and have no dependencies other than a Linux kernel
supporting inotify.

inotify-tools includes:
* inotifywait: This program just blocks for inotify events.
					It can watch any set of files and
					directories,
					and can recursively watch entire
					directory trees.
* inotifywatch:
					inotifywatch collects filesystem
					usage statistics and outputs counts
					of each inotify event.
