cat << EOF
Lightweight tool for hosting KVM guests. As a pure virtualization tool it
only supports guests using the same architecture, though it supports running
32-bit guests on those 64-bit architectures that allow this.

The goal of this tool is to provide a clean, from-scratch, lightweight KVM
host tool implementation that can boot Linux guest images (just a hobby,
won't be big and professional like QEMU) with no BIOS dependencies and with
only the minimal amount of legacy device emulation.
