cat << EOF
Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd. Among other features, it
offers support for on-demand disk buffering, reliable syslog over TCP, writing
to databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many more), fully configurable
output formats (including high-precision timestamps), the ability to filter
on any part of the syslog message, on-the-wire message compression, and the
ability to convert text files to syslog. It is a drop-in replacement for
stock syslogd and able to work with the same configuration file syntax.

Since 3.19.0, rsyslog supports over-the-wire TLS encryption for TCP streams.
