GrafX2 is a bitmap paint program inspired by the Amiga programs Deluxe
Paint and Brilliance. Specialized in 256-color drawing, it includes a very
large number of tools and effects that make it particularly suitable for pixel
art, game graphics, and generally any detailed graphics painted with a mouse.

The program is mostly developed on Haiku, Linux and Windows, but is also
portable on many other platforms.
