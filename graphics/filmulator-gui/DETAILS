A Qt Quick GUI adaptation of Filmulator --- a film emulator with all of the
positives and none of the negatives.

Filmulator accepts raw files from cameras and simulates the development of
film as if exposed to the same light as the camera's sensor. For various
reasons, this inherently brings about several benefits:

* Large bright regions become darker, compressing the output dynamic range.
* Small bright regions make their surroundings darker, enhancing local
  contrast.
* In bright regions, saturation is enhanced, helping retain color in blue
  skies, brighter skin tones, and sunsets.
* In extremely saturated regions, the brightness is attenuated, helping retain
  detail e.g. in flowers.

The program's design ideology is to have the best tool for any job, and
only that one tool. The tradeoff here is a slight decrease in flexibility,
but gaining a greatly simplified and streamlined user interface.
