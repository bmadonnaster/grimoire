ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available as
Open Source under the AGPL. It supports accurate ICC profile creation
for scanners, cameras and film recorders, and calibration and profiling of
displays and RGB & CMYK printers. Spectral sample data is supported, allowing
a selection of illuminants observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener
additive compensation. Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut
mappings for perceptual and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile
linking uses the CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm,
and a wide selection of rendering intents. Device Link can be created with
a wide variety of advanced options. It also includes code for the fastest
portable 8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere, as well
as support for fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts
can also be viewed and compared using a VRML viewer.
