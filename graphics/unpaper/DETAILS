npaper is a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper, especially for
book pages that have been scanned from previously created photocopies. The
main purpose is to make scanned book pages better readable on screen after
conversion to PDF. Additionally, unpaper might be useful to enhance the
quality of scanned pages before performing optical character recognition
(OCR). unpaper tries to clean scanned images by removing dark edges that
appeared through scanning or copying on areas outside the actual page content
(e.g. dark areas between the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side of a
double- sided book-page scan). The program also tries to detect disaligned
centering and rotation of pages and will automatically straighten each page
by rotating it to the correct angle.
