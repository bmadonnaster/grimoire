APNG Disassembler deconstructs APNG file into a sequence of PNG frames.

Command line: apngdis anim.png [name]
                                        
Decoding is implemented by parsing all chunks in the APNG file, remuxing
them into a sequence of static PNG images, as shown in the diagram below,
and then using regular (unpatched) libpng to decode them.
                         
Then, after processing blend/dispose operations, we finally get a vector
of full-size frames in 32 bpp as the result.

Command-line version is available for all major OSes, there is also a GUI
version for Windows. C++ source code is available under zlib license.
