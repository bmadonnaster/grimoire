DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. Its purpose is to provide
a single front end for all tests. Think of it as a custom library of Tcl
procedures crafted to support writing a test harness. A test harness is
the testing infrastructure that is created to support a specific program or
tool. Each program can have multiple testsuites, all supported by a single
test harness.

DejaGnu is written in Expect, which in turn uses Tcl -- Tool command language.
