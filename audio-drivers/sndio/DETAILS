Sndio is a small audio and MIDI framework part of the OpenBSD project and
ported to FreeBSD, Linux and NetBSD. It provides a lightweight audio & MIDI
server and a fully documented user-space API to access either the server or
directly the hardware in a uniform way. Sndio is designed to work for desktop
release-service, but pays special attention to synchronization mechanisms and
reliability required by music release-service. Reliability through simplicity
are part of the project goals.
