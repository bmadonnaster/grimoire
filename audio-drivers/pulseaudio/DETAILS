PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
Win32 systems. A sound server is basically a proxy for your sound applications.
It allows you to do advanced operations on your sound data as it passes between
your application and your hardware. Things like transferring the audio to a
different machine, changing the sample format or channel count and mixing
several sounds into one are easily achieved using a sound server.
