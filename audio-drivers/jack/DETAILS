cat << EOF
JACK is a low-latency audio server, written for POSIX conformant operating 
systems such as GNU/Linux and Apple's OS X. It can connect a number of 
different applications to an audio device, as well as allowing them to share 
audio between themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as 
normal applications), or can they can run within the JACK server (ie. as a 
"plugin").
JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and its 
design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and 
low latency operation.
