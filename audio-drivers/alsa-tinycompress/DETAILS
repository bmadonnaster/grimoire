tinycompress is a userspace library for anyone who wants to use the ALSA
compressed APIs introduced in Linux 3.3.

This library provides the APIs to open a ALSA compressed device and read/write
compressed data like MP3 etc to it.

This also includes a utility command line player (cplay) which demonstrates
the usage of this API.
