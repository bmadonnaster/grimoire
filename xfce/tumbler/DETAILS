Tumbler is a D-Bus service for applications to request thumbnails for various
URI schemes and MIME types. It is an implementation of the thumbnail management
D-Bus specification described on:

  http://live.gnome.org/ThumbnailerSpec

written in an object-oriented fashion using GLib and GObject. Its modular
architecture makes it very flexible and useful in many situations. It provides
plugin interfaces for extending the URI schemes and MIME types for which
thumbnails can be generated as well as for replacing the storage backend that is
used to store the thumbnails on disk. Tumbler's functionality can also be
extended via specialized thumbnailer services implemented in accordance to the
thumbnail management D-Bus specification.
