musl, pronounced like the word "mussel", is an MIT-licensed implementation of
the standard C library targetting the Linux syscall API, suitable for use in a
wide range of deployment environments. musl offers efficient static and dynamic
linking support, lightweight code and low runtime overhead, strong fail-safe
guarantees under correct usage, and correctness in the sense of standards
conformance and safety. musl is built on the principle that these goals are
best achieved through simple code that is easy to understand and maintain.

The 1.1 release series for musl features coverage for all interfaces defined
in ISO C99 and POSIX 2008 base, along with a number of non-standardized
interfaces for compatibility with Linux, BSD, and glibc functionality.
