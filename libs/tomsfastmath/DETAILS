TomsFastMath is a fast public domain, open source, large integer arithmetic
library written in portable ISO C. It is a port of LibTomMath with optional
support for inline assembler multipliers. It has the following features.

* Public domain, open source and freely accessible
* Builds with GCC [preferably v3.3.x or higher] on any 32-bit/64-bit box
* Includes ASM optimizations (inline) for
  - x86-32 (e.g. i386 and SSE2)
  - x86-64 (e.g. AMD64)
  - ARM (ARMv4 and higher)
  - PPC32 (e.g. G3/G4)
  - PPC64 (e.g. G5)
  - AVR32 (Atmel 32-bit RISC processor)
  - MIPS (32-bit)
* Includes fairly complete API (provides most of what LibTomMath provides)
* Uses similar API as LibTomMath makes porting easy
* Competitive speeds (and getting higher).
  - Faster than OpenSSL on the AMD64
  - Still room for improvements
* No heap usage (malloc/calloc/free)
* Uses only inline asm, simplifies build process, simple to add new ports
