cat << EOF
libstatgrab is a library that provides cross platform access to statistics
about the system on which it's run.  It's written in C and presents a selection
of useful interfaces which can be used to access key system statistics. The
current list of statistics includes CPU usage, memory utilisation, disk usage,
process counts, network traffic, disk I/O, and more.  The current list of
platforms is Solaris 2.x, Linux 2.2/2.4/2.6, FreeBSD 4.x/5.x, NetBSD 1.6.x,
OpenBSD 3.x, DragonFly BSD 1.0, HP-UX, and Cygwin. The aim is to extend this
to include as many operating systems as possible.
