The libt3key library provides functions for retrieving the character sequences
used by terminals to represent keys pressed by the user. Although the terminfo
database provides part of this information, it lacks information for the
sequences returned by modern terminals/terminal emulators for many combinations
of modifiers with other keys. For example, many terminal emulators provide
separate character sequences for Control combined with the cursor keys, which is
not stored in the terminfo database.

Many programs contain their own databases with this information. This library
tries to be a database usable by many programs, such that all programs can
benefit from the information collected.
