libwpd is a C++ library designed to help process WordPerfect documents. It is 
most commonly used to import WordPerfect documents into other word processors 
(see below), but may be useful in other cases as well.

libwpd exposes a simple callback-based API (similar to SAX), allowing it to be 
easily plugged into any C or C++ application. It strictly depends only on an 
implementation of the STL, although by interfacing with a library which 
abstracts the Microsoft OLE format (such as libgsf), you gain the ability to 
import OLE-embedded WordPerfect documents.
