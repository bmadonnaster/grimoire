cat << EOF
The main motivation for VA-API (Video Acceleration API) is to enable
hardware accelerated video decode/encode at various entry-points (VLD,
IDCT, Motion Compensation etc.) for the prevailing coding standards
today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, and VC-1/VMW3).
Extending XvMC was considered, but due to its original design for MPEG-2
MotionComp only, it made more sense to design an interface from scratch
that can fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs.

The current video decode/encode interface is window system independent,
so that potentially it can be used with graphics sub-systems other than
X. In a nutshell it is basically a scheme to pass various types of data
buffers from the application to the GPU for decoding or encoding.
Feedback on the API is greatly welcomed, as this is intended to be a
community collaborative effort.
