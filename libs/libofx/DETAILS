The LibOFX library is a parser and an API designed to allow applications to
very easily support OFX command responses, usually provided by financial
institutions for statement downloads. It is a working OpenSource
implementation of the OFX (Open Financial eXchange) specification on the
client side. This project was first started with the objective to add OFX
support to GnuCash. It since evolved into a generic library, so all
OpenSource Financial software can benefit.
