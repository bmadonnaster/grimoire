Sodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption,
signatures, password hashing and more.

It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl, with
a compatible API, and an extended API to improve usability even further. Its
goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level
cryptographic tools.

The design choices emphasize security, and "magic constants" have clear
rationales.

And despite the emphasis on high security, primitives are faster
across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.
