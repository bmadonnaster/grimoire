Liblogging is an easy to use, portable, open source library for system
logging. It comes with an BSD-style license. Liblogging was initiated
by Rainer Gerhards.

The original idea was to provide a very slim BEEP look-alike to
implement with a few hundered lines of code. Well, during development
new ideas popped up and the design goal now has evolved to provide a
library useful for all kinds of system logging.

Liblogging is unique in the way that it was specifically designed for
system logging and ease of use. There are many BEEP libraries out there
and most of them support the syslog reliable RAW profile. However, these
libraries have a very complex API, which is overdone just for logging.
Software implementors stay away from those libraries. We hope that
liblogging will make reliable syslog available to everyone. There is a
very short, easy to use and learn API.
