The libt3window library provides functions for manipulating the terminal and for
creating (possibly overlapping) windows on a terminal. libt3window can be used
instead of (n)curses for drawing on the terminal. libt3window provides the
following features:
* (Overlapping) windows for drawing. Overlapping windows hide windows deeper in
  the window stack.
* Clipping of windows to the size of the parent window.
* UTF-8 used internally, which is converted to the terminal encoding before
  output. libt3window depends on libunistring for UTF-8 processing and
  libtranscript for character set conversion.
* Provides easy access to the most needed terminal functionality.
* Small code size.
