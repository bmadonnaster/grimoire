libepubgen is a library for generating documents in (surprise!) EPUB format,
implementing librevenge document interfaces. It supports conversion of text
documents, presentations and vector drawings. Spreadsheets are not supported,
because conversion of a spreadsheet to EPUB does not (IMHO) make much sense. As
these interfaces are used by multiple libraries, libepubgen can be used to
generate EPUB from many sources.
