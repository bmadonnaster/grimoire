librelp is an easy to use library for the RELP protocol. RELP in turn
provides reliable event logging over the network (and consequently RELP
stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol). RELP was initiated by
Rainer Gerhards after he was finally upset by the lossy nature of plain
tcp syslog and wanted a cure for all these dangling issues.

RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when
connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current version
of RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication
after a session has been broken due to network problems. In this case,
a few messages may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain
tcp syslog). Future versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.

Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol.
Even though it was designed to solve the urgent need of
rsyslog-to-rsyslog communication, RELP supports many more applications.
Extensible command verbs provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol
without affecting existing applications.
