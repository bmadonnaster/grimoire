cat << EOF
libfilezilla is a small and modern C++ library, offering some basic
functionality to build high-performing, platform-independent programs. Some
of the highlights include:

* A typesafe, multi-threaded event system that's very simple to use yet
  extremely efficient
* Timers for periodic events * A datetime class that not only tracks timestamp
but also their accuracy,
  which simplifies dealing with timestamps originating from different sources
* Simple process handling for spawning child processes with redirected I/O
