cat << EOF
This VDPAU driver (libvdpau_va_gl.so.1) uses OpenGL to accelerate presentation
(rendering and scaling), and VA-API (if available) to accelerate video
decoding. For now VA-API is available on some Intel chips, and on some AMD video
adapters with the help of xvba-va-driver.

This enables applications supporting only VDPAU to use an accelerated backend on
hardware that doesn't provide native VDPAU drivers.

Which driver to use is determined by asking X server about current driver name
or by using VDPAU_DRIVER environment variable.
