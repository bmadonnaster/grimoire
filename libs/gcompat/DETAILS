cat << EOF
This distribution contains the implementation of gcompat, a library which
provides glibc-compatible APIs for use on musl libc systems.

This library is designed to be used for binaries that are already compiled
against glibc. It does not contain any headers, and cannot be used to build
software that requires glibc. It is instead recommended that any software that
requires glibc APIs be modified to become more portable.

This library can optionally be compiled with other libraries to make a single,
unfied solution. This can include fts, libucontext, obstack, and others.

gcompat additionally provides a loader stub. This is a small library that has
the same name as the glibc dynamic linker on glibc platforms; when a binary is
run that uses glibc as its dynamic linker, the stub will run, redirecting it to
use musl and automatically preloading the gcompat library.
