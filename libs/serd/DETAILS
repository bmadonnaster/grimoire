cat << EOF
Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading and
writing Turtle and NTriples.

Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
is suited to resource limited or performance critical applications
(e.g. converting many gigabytes of NTriples to Turtle), or situations where
a simple reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2
implementations or embedded applications).
