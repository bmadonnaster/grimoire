Intel? Threading Building Blocks (TBB) offers a rich and complete approach to
expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library that helps you take
advantage of multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading
expert. Threading Building Blocks is not just a threads-replacement library. It
represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform
details and threading mechanisms for scalability and performance.
