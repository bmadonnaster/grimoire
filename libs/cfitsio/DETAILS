CFITSIO is a library of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and writing
data files in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format. CFITSIO
provides simple high-level routines for reading and writing FITS files
that insulate the programmer from the internal complexities of the FITS
format. CFITSIO also provides many advanced features for manipulating and
filtering the information in FITS files.
