cat << EOF
Rasqal is a C library for querying RDF, supporting the RDQL and SPARQL
languages. It provides APIs for creating a query and parsing query syntax. It
features pluggable triple-store source and matching interfaces, an engine for
executing the queries and an API for manipulating results as bindings. It uses
the Raptor RDF parser to return triples from RDF content and can alternatively
work with the Redland RDF library's persistent triple stores. It is portable
across many POSIX systems, win32 and others.
