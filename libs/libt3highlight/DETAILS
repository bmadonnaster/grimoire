The libt3highlight library provides functions for syntax-highlighting different
types of text files. Its main design goal is an easily restartable syntax
highlighting, suitable for use in interactive text editors.

To make the syntax highlighting restartable, libt3highlight uses a single
integer start-of-line state. However, it does provide several advanced features,
such as dynamic end-of-state patterns, which make it possible to highlight
complex languages like Perl and Bash with high fidelity.
