libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under the terms of
the LGPL, and written in C. It supports sections and (lists of) values
(strings, integers, floats, booleans or other sections), as well as some other
features (such as single/double-quoted strings, environment variable
expansion, functions and nested include statements). It makes it very easy to
add configuration file capability to a program using a simple API.

The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser library with
a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to
integrate with your code. libConfuse was called libcfg before, but was changed
to not confuse with other similar libraries.
