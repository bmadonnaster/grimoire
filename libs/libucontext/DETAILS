cat << EOF
This distribution contains the implementation of libucontext, a library which
provides the <ucontext.h> API from older POSIX revisions. Unlike other
implementations, it faithfully follows the kernel process ABI when performing
context swaps.

When combined with gcompat, it provides a full implementation of the
<ucontext.h> functions that are ABI compatible with glibc.

The <ucontext.h> functions are deprecated in POSIX, and therefore are not
implemented in the musl libc. However, these functions are still used in some
legacy packages. They are also notably used by GCC's implementation of the Go
programming language. Therefore, it is desireable for us to be able to support
the execution of software that utilises this deprecated API.
