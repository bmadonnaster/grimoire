Enchant is a library (and command-line program) that wraps a number of different
spelling libraries and programs with a consistent interface. By using Enchant,
you can use a wide range of spelling libraries, including some specialised for
particular languages, without needing to program to each library's interface. If
it's not convenient to call a C library, you can access most of Enchant's
functionality via the enchant program, which communicates over a pipe
(ispell-compatible).

Backends:
* Hunspell (used by many other programs, including Firefox and Thunderbird)
* Nuspell (newest spell checker to be used by many other programs, including
  Firefox and Thunderbird)
* GNU Aspell (old Ispell replacement)
* Hspell (Hebrew)
* Voikko (Finnish)
* Zemberek (Turkish)
