The Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing project (HPLIP) provides a
unified single and multi-function connectivity solution for Linux. The goal
of this project is to provide "radically simple" printing, faxing, scanning,
photo-card access, and device management to the consumer and small business
desktop Linux users. This project is based open source software and uses GPL
compatible licenses.

See http://hplip.sourceforge.net/ for instructions on how to configure your
printer to use the hplip driver.

Formerly known as hpijs. OpenPrinting.org still refers to this driver by that
name.
