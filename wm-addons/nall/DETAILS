Nall is a small gtk+ application that discretely fits into your freedesktop
system tray. Its purpose is to spawn periodically every kind of script and
display a one-line output in the tooltip window. The main usage of nall is
monitoring or just notifying of almost everything (it just depends upon your
imagination and ability to script).
