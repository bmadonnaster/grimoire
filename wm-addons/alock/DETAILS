cat << EOF
Alock is a simple screen lock application, which locks the X server until the
correct password is provided. If the authentication was successful, the X
server is unlocked and the user can continue to work. When 'alock' is started
it just waits for the first keypress. This first keypress is to indicate that
the user now wants to type in the password. Such a behavior might seem to be
annoying at the first glance, however this approach is chosen due to security
reasons.
