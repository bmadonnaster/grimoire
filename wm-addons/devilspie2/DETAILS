Devilspie2 is a window-matching utility, allowing the user to perform scripted
actions on windows as they are created. For example, you can script a terminal
program to always be positioned at a specific screen position, or position a
window on a specific workspace.

Devilspie2 is based on the program Devilspie by Ross Burton. The difference is
that Devilspie2 has replaced the symbolic expressions of the original with a
Lua interpreter, making it much easier to maintain and extend.

Please note that the rules of Devilspie2 are not compatible with the symbolic
expressions of the original Devilspie.
