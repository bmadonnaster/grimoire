Imlib2 is the successor to Imlib. It is NOT a newer version -- it is a
completely new library. Imlib 2 can be installed alongside Imlib 1.x
without any problems since they are effectively different libraries
which have very similar functionality. Please see the homepage for the
long description of the differences.
