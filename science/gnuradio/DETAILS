GNU Radio is a free software development toolkit that provides the signal
processing runtime and processing blocks to implement software radios using
readily-available, low-cost external RF hardware and commodity processors. It
is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments to support
wireless communications research as well as to implement real-world radio
systems.

GNU Radio applications are primarily written using the Python programming
language, while the supplied, performance-critical signal processing path is
implemented in C++ using processor floating point extensions where available.
Thus, the developer is able to implement real-time, high-throughput radio
systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.
