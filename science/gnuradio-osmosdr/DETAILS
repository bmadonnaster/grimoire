 OsmoSDR is a 100% Free Software based small form-factor inexpensive SDR
 (Software Defined Radio) project.

 If you are familiar with existing SDR receivers, then OsmoSDR can be thought
 of something in between a â€‹FunCube Dongle (only 96kHz bandwidth) and a USRP
 (much more expensive). For a very cheap SDR (with limited dynamic range), you
 can use the DVB-T USB stick using the RTL2832U chip, as documented in rtl-sdr.

 It consists of a USB-attached Hardware, associated Firmware as well as
 GrOsmoSDR gnuradio integration on the PC.
