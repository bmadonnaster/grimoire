* Computes heliocentric, geocentric and topocentric information for all 
objects;
* Has built-in support for all planets; the moons of Mars, Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus and Earth; central meridian longitude of Mars and 
Jupiter; Saturn's rings; and Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
* Allows user-defined objects including stars, deepsky objects, 
asteroids, comets and Earth satellites.
* Offers many large databases including Tycho, Hipparcos, GSC, USNO.
* Displays data in configurable tabular formats in conjunction with 
several interactive graphical views;
* Graphically displays a 24 hour period showing when any selected 
objects are up;
* Displays 3-D stereo views of the Solar System that are particularly 
well suited for visualizing comet trajectories;
* Quickly finds all close pairs of objects in the sky;
* Sorts and prints all catalogs with very flexible criteria for creating 
custom observing lists;
* Can create plots of any pairs of all data fields throughout the 
program;
* Downloads AAVSO light curves directly online;
* Downloads current asteroid and comets lists from Lowell and MPC;
* Downloads timely Earth satellite orbital TLE parameters;
* Downloads Digitized Sky Survey FITS files from STScI or ESO;
* Displays seti@home client progress and plots position being processed 
on Sky View map;
* Provides a handy spreadsheet for converting among equatorial, 
ecliptic, horizontal and galactic coordinates;
* Includes a compiler for entering and solving user-written functions 
using any data fields;
* Serves as the control point for GOTO telescopes such as Meade LX200 
(Mac users will need a USB-to-Serial adaptor, not included, but we do 
support those made by KeySpan);
* Displays FITS files and DSS images overlaid with properly registered 
database symbols and other graphical information;
* Performs automatic star pattern matching to solve for accurate World 
Coordinate System on any image;
* Performs 1-click 2D Gaussian relative and absolute photometry;
* Lets you define and save any number of Eyepieces to use in sky maps;
* Displays your own local horizon profile;
* Can store sets of Sky View options for easy playback later;
* Uses high quality Postscript for all printing.
