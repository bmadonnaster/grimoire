	* PRE_BUILD: Fix compilation with gcc 4.2 (Bug #14145)
	  See http://maillist.perforce.com/pipermail/jamming/2007-May/002913.html

2007-01-20 Florian Franzmann <bwlf@bandrate.org>
	* DEPENDS: added dependency on bison
	* BUILD: added make_single before make to fix a compile error,
	  force the build process to use bison instead of yacc
2006-08-18 Pol Vinogradov <vin.public@gmail.com>
	* DETAILS: MD5 -> SHA512, removed UPDATED and BUILD_API=2, added DOCS
	* PRE_BUILD: added sedit lines for substituing our {C,LD}FLAGS and for
	  switching to _Exit function to avoid warning messages
	* INSTALL: install_rootifying, removed installing RELEASE file because
	  DOCS has it, and chmod line was removed too as install does the same

2004-11-28 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* Bug from http://forums.sourcemage.org/viewtopic.php?p=3914
	* DETAILS: Fixed md5sum (.zip changed)
	  Removed MAINTAINER
	  Shortened SHORT
	  Added BUILD_API=2
	* BUILD: Converted to BUILD_API 2
	* INSTALL: Added
	* PRE_BUILD: Added (no longer uncompresses to a directory)

2003-11-29 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: Updated to 2.5
	  Changed .tar to .zip, as Sorcery seems to have problems with uncompressed
	  archives (http://forums.sourcemage.org/viewtopic.php?t=410)
	  Removed the HTTP URL, as it no longer exists
	* HISTORY: Formatted to Guru Handbook

2003-05-14 Seth Woolley <seth@tautology.org>
	* Removed PRE_BUILD since uncompressed tars do in fact
	  work with default_pre_build, fixing unpack() issue as a 
	  sideeffect.
