cat << EOF
Capstone is a lightweight multi-platform, multi-architecture disassembly
framework.

Our target is to make Capstone the ultimate disassembly engine for binary
analysis and reversing in the security community.

Highlight features:

* Multi-architectures: Arm, Arm64 (Armv8), M68K, Mips, PowerPC, Sparc,
  SystemZ, XCore & X86 (include X86_64) (details).

* Clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.

* Provide details on disassembled instruction (called "decomposer" by some
  others).

* Provide some semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of
  implicit registers read & written.

* Implemented in pure C language, with bindings for Haskell, Perl, Python,
  Ruby, C#, NodeJS, Java, GO, C++, OCaml, Lua, Rust, Delphi, Free Pascal &
  Vala available.

* Native support for Windows & *nix (with Mac OSX, iOS, Android, Linux,
  *BSD & Solaris confirmed).

* Thread-safe by design.

* Special support for embedding into firmware or OS kernel.

* High performance & suitable for malware analysis (capable of handling
  various X86 malware tricks).

* Distributed under the open source BSD license.
