CIL is a front-end for the C programming language that facilitates program
analysis and transformation. CIL will parse and typecheck a program, and
compile it into a simplified subset of C.

CIL supports ANSI C as well as most of the extensions of the GNU C and
Microsoft C compilers. A Perl script acts as a drop in replacement for either
gcc or Microsoft's cl, and allows merging of the source files in your project.
Other features include support for control-flow and points-to analyses.
