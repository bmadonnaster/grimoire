Fossil is a simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration
management system with these advanced features:

* Project Management - In addition to doing distributed version control like
  Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports bug tracking, wiki, forum, email
  alerts, chat, and technotes.

* Built-in Web Interface - Fossil has a built-in, themeable, extensible, and
  intuitive web interface with a rich variety of information pages (examples)
  promoting situational awareness.

* This entire website is just a running instance of Fossil. The pages you see
  here are all wiki or embedded documentation or (in the case of the
  download page) unversioned files. When you clone Fossil from one of its
  self-hosting repositories, you get more than just source code - you get
  this entire website.

* All-in-one - Fossil is a single self-contained, stand-alone executable. To
  install, simply download a precompiled binary for Linux, Mac, or Windows
  and put it on your $PATH. Easy-to-compile source code is also available.

* Self-host Friendly - Stand up a project website in minutes using a variety
  of techniques. Fossil is CPU and memory efficient. Most projects can be
  hosted comfortably on a $5/month VPS or a Raspberry Pi. You can also set
  up an automatic GitHub mirror.

* Simple Networking - Fossil uses ordinary HTTPS (or SSH if you prefer) for
  network communications, so it works fine from behind firewalls and
  proxies. The protocol is bandwidth efficient to the point that Fossil can
  be used comfortably over dial-up, weak 3G, or airliner Wifi.

* Autosync - Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to keep projects
  moving forward by reducing the amount of needless forking and merging
  often associated with distributed projects.

* Robust & Reliable - Fossil stores content using an enduring file format in
  an SQLite database so that transactions are atomic even if interrupted
  by a power loss or system crash. Automatic self-checks verify that all
  aspects of the repository are consistent prior to each commit.
