CMake is a cross-platform, open-source make system. CMake is used to
control the software compilation process using simple platform and
compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native
makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment
of your choice. CMake is quite sophisticated: it is possible to
support complex environments requiring system configuration,
pre-processor generation, code generation, and template instantiation.
