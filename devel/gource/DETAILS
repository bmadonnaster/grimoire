Software projects are displayed by Gource as an animated tree with the root
directory of the project at its centre. Directories appear as branches with
files as leaves. Developers can be seen working on the tree at the times they
contributed to the project.

Currently there is first party support for Git and Mercurial, and third party
(using additional steps) for CVS and SVN.
