cat << EOF
jemalloc is a general purpose malloc(3) implementation that
emphasizes fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support.
jemalloc first came into use as the FreeBSD libc allocator in 2005,
and since then it has found its way into numerous applications that
rely on its predictable behavior. In 2010 jemalloc development
efforts broadened to include developer support features such as heap
profiling and extensive monitoring/tuning hooks. Modern jemalloc
releases continue to be integrated back into FreeBSD, and therefore
versatility remains critical. Ongoing development efforts trend
toward making jemalloc among the best allocators for a broad range
of demanding applications, and eliminating/mitigating weaknesses that
have practical repercussions for real world applications.
