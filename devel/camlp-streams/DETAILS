The Stream and Genlex libraries for use with Camlp4 and Camlp5

The camlp-streams package provides two library modules:

* Stream: imperative streams, with in-place update and memoization of the
  latest element produced.
* Genlex: a small parameterized lexical analyzer producing streams of tokens
  from streams of characters.

The two modules are designed for use with Camlp4 and Camlp5:

* The stream patterns and stream expressions of Camlp4/Camlp5 consume and
  produce data of type 'a Stream.t.
* The Genlex tokenizer can be used as a simple lexical analyzer for
  Camlp4/Camlp5-generated parsers.

The Stream module can also be used by hand-written recursive-descent parsers,
but is not very convenient for this purpose.

The Stream and Genlex modules were part of the OCaml standard library. They
were deprecated in Ocaml 4.14.0, but will be maintained and distributed
separately in this camlp-streams package.
