cat << EOF
NASM is an 80x86 assembler designed for portability and modularity. Its syntax
is designed to be simple and easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less
complex.

It supports a range of object file formats, including Linux and NetBSD/FreeBSD
a.out and ELF, COFF, Microsoft 16-bit OBJ and Win32. It will also output plain
binary files.

It supports Pentium, P6, MMX, 3DNow!, SSE and SSE2 opcodes, and has macro
capability. It includes a disassembler as well.
