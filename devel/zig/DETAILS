cat << EOF
Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining
robust, optimal, and reusable software.

* A Simple Language

Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming
language knowledge.

- No hidden control flow.
- No hidden memory allocations.
- No preprocessor, no macros.

* Comptime

A fresh approach to metaprogramming based on compile-time code execution
and lazy evaluation.

- Call any function at compile-time.
- Manipulate types as values without runtime overhead.
- Comptime emulates the target architecture.

* Performance Meets Safety

Write fast, clear code capable of handling all error conditions.

- The language gracefully guides your error handling logic.
- Configurable runtime checks help you strike a balance between performance
  and safety guarantees.
- Take advantage of vector types to express SIMD instructions portably.
