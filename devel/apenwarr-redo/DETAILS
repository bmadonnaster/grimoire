Smaller, easier, more powerful, and more reliable than make.

This is an implementation of Daniel J. Bernstein's redo build system. He
never released his version, so other people have implemented different
variants based on his published specification.

This version, sometimes called apenwarr/redo, is probably the most advanced
one, including parallel builds, improved logging, extensive automated tests,
and helpful debugging features.
