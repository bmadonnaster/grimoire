cat << EOF
Chez Scheme is both a programming language and an implementation of that
language, with supporting tools and documentation.

As a superset of the language described in the Revised6 Report on the
Algorithmic Language Scheme (R6RS), Chez Scheme supports all standard features
of Scheme, including first-class procedures, proper treatment of tail calls,
continuations, user-defined records, libraries, exceptions, and hygienic
macro expansion.

Chez Scheme also includes extensive support for interfacing with C and other
languages, support for multiple threads possibly running on multiple cores,
non-blocking I/O, and many other features.
