Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming
language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional runtime
requirements and without using a different ABI compared to applications and
libraries written in C.
valac, the Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates Vala
source code into C source and header files. It uses the GObject type system to
create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala source code. It's also
planned to generate GIDL files when gobject-introspection is ready.
