cat << EOF
This is a minimalist decentralized issue management system based on Git,
offering (optional) biderectional integration with GitHub and GitLab issue
management. It has the following advantages over other systems.

* No backend, no dependencies: You can install and use git issue with a
  single shell command. There's no need for a server or a database back-end,
  and the corresponding problems and requirements for their administration.
* Decentralized asynchronous management: Anyone can add, comment, and edit
  issues without requiring online access to a centralized server. There's no
  need for online connectivity; you can pull and push issues when you're
  online.
* Transparent text file format: Issues are stored as simple text files,
  which you can view, edit, share, and backup with any tool you like. There's
  no risk of losing access to your issues because a server has failed.
* Git-based: Issues are changed and shared through Git. This provides git issue
  with a robust, efficient, portable, and widely available infrastructure. It
  allows you to reuse your Git credentials and infrastructure, allows the
  efficient merging of work, and also provides a solid audit trail regarding
  any changes. You can even use Git and command-line tools directly to make
  sophisticated changes to your issue database.
