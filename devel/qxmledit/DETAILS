QXmlEdit is a simple XML editor written in qt4/5. Its main features are unusual data visualization 
modes, nice XML manipulation and presentation and it is multi platform. It can split very big XML 
files into fragments, and compare XML files. It is one of the few graphical Open Source XSD 
viewers.
