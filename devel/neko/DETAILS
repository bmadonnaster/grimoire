cat << EOF
Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language. It can be used as
an embedded scripting language. It has been designed to provide a common runtime
for several different languages. Learning and using Neko is very easy. You can
easily extend the language with C libraries. You can also write generators from
your own language to Neko and then use the Neko Runtime to compile, run, and
access existing libraries.
