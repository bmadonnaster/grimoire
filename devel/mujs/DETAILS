MuJS is a lightweight Javascript interpreter designed for embedding in other
software to extend them with scripting capabilities.

MuJS was designed with a focus on small size, correctness, and simplicity. It
is written in portable C and implements ECMAScript as specified by
ECMA-262. The interface for binding with native code is designed to be as
simple as possible to use, and is very similar to Lua. There is no need to
interact with byzantine C++ template mechanisms, or worry about marking and
unmarking garbage collection roots, or wrestle with obscure build systems.

MuJS is developed and maintained by Artifex Software. It was originally
developed for use with the MuPDF viewer, but is designed to be useful as an
independent component.
