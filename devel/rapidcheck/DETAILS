cat << EOF
RapidCheck is a C++ framework for property based testing inspired by
QuickCheck and other similar frameworks. In property based testing, you
state facts about your code that given certain precondition should always
be true. RapidCheck then generates random test data to try and find a case
for which the property doesn't hold. If such a case is found, RapidCheck
tries to find the smallest case (for some definition of smallest) for which
the property is still false and then displays this as a counterexample. For
example, if the input is an integer, RapidCheck tries to find the smallest
integer for which the property is false.
