rr aspires to be your primary C/C++ debugging tool for Linux, replacing —
well, enhancing — gdb. You record a failure once, then debug the recording,
deterministically, as many times as you want. The same execution is replayed
every time.

rr also provides efficient reverse execution under gdb. Set breakpoints and
data watchpoints and quickly reverse-execute to where they were hit.

rr works on real applications and is used by many developers to fix real bugs.
It makes debugging hard bugs much easier, but also speeds up debugging of
easy bugs.
