Fvwm95 is a hack based on fvwm2. It tries to emulate the good features of
a well known product without bloating the regular fvwm code.

The main aspects are:

* MS Windows 95 look and feel.
* Same flexible and easy configuration as the native fvwm.
* Functionality extensible via loadable modules.
* A taskbar: find quickly an application window and don't take space with
  icon windows.
