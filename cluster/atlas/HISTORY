	* PRE_BUILD, no_fortran.patch: Replaced patch by sed expression

2015-05-25 Thomas Orgis <sobukus@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: remove SOURCEFORGE_URL usage (automated)

2012-06-22 Sukneet Basuta <sukneet@sourcemage.org>
	* PRE_BUILD: if optional fortran depends is not enabled, apply
	  patch to not compile fortran libs
	* no_fortran.patch: added, patch to not compile fortran libs
	* BUILD: Only install fortran libs if optional fortran depends is enabled

2011-05-15 Peng Chang (Charels) <chp@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD: fat_shared is still not prevailing, added make check and make time,
	  these takes only 2 min, but definitely worth keeping record
	* DEPENDS: force_depends lapack when necessary
	* DETAILS: updated to 3.8.4
	* PRE_BUILD: patch archinfo_x86.c; there's no reference builds for Corei2,
	  which will cause build failure and the detection for Corei2 is buggy, so
	  only Corei1 will be used
	* x86.patch: the patch for archinfo_x86.c
	* emit_mm.patch: not necessary any more

2011-05-14 Peng Chang (Charles) <chp@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD, CONFIGURE, INSTALL: shared library is common practice and
	  required by nearly all dependents; so it is no longer an option,
	  and shared library is built nonetheless; and pt libraries will
	  never be used if they are named thus, so decide what kind of libraries
	  will be used at compilation time; I trust you can make the choice
	  if you really care how atlas performs
	* DETAILS: PATCHLEVEL++
	* PRE_BUILD: patching configure, removing duplicate object file from
	  liblapack.a
	* configure.patch: the patch

2011-05-13 Peng Chang (Charles) <chp@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: PATCHLEVEL++
	* BUILD, CONFIGURE: clean up ineffective options
	* BUILD: fixed a bug unnoticed for 2 years, appending ${OPTS} to the end
	  of configure
	* PRE_BUILD: applying upstream patch to fix code generation problems
	  during build
	* emit_mm.patch: the above patch generated from upstream update

2009-05-17 Peng Chang (Charles) <chp516@gmail.com>
	* BUILD: changed accordingly
	* CONFIGURE: added this file to query various options
	* DEPENDS: added optional_depends lapack
	* DETAILS: version 3.8.3, this version has a new building and
	  installing scheme
	* CONFLICTS: resolved conflict with lapack. atlas should work
	  _with_ lapack, rather than conflict lapack
	* INSTALL: changed accordingly
	* PRE_BUILD: added accordingly
	* README: attentions before building atlas
	* TRIGGERS: used to resolve conflicts with lapack
	* atlas-nog77.config, atlas-alpha.config: probably no longer
	  needed

2007-06-04 Thomas Orgis <sobukus@sourcemage.org>
	* BUILD, atlas-alpha.config: make it work on alphas,
	  prepare for better fortran handling for others, too
	* atlas-nog77.config: use symbol FORTRAN instead of
	  anonymous 0

2006-11-01 Jaka Kranjc <lynxlynxlynx@sourcemage.org>
	* DEPENDS: add optional fortran
	* BUILD: add fortran when requested and fix #9380
	* atlas-nog77.config: renamed; make doesn't like <, part of #9380
	* DETAILS: ++PATCHLEVEL
