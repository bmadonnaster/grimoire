Graphene provides common types needed to handle 3D transformations:
  * 2D points
  * 3D points
  * triangles
  * rectangles
  * quads
  * quaternions
  * euler angles
  * vectors (2, 3, or 4-sized)
  * matrices
  * planes
  * 3D boxes
  * spheres
  * frustums

Graphene also provides its low-level SIMD vector and matrix types, which are
used to implement the API above.

All types can be placed on the stack, but provide allocation/free functions for
working on the heap as well. The contents of all structure types, unless noted
otherwise, should be considered private, and should never be accessed directly.
