dar is a shell command that backs up directory trees and files. It has been
tested under Linux, Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, and NetBSD, and is released
under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Since version 2.0.0 an Application
Interface (API) is available, opening the way for external/independent
Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) like kdar. This API relies on the libdar
library, which is the core part of DAR programs; as such, the API is released
under the GPL. Consequently, to use the API, your program must be released
under the GPL as well.
