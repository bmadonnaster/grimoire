cat << EOF
UPX is a versatile executable packer with the following features:

    * excellent compression ratio: typically compresses better than
    WinZip/zip/gzip, use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution !

    * very fast decompression: ~10 MB/sec on an ancient Pentium 133,
    ~200 MB/sec on an Athlon XP 2000+.

    * no memory overhead for your compressed executables because of
    in-place decompression.

    * safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables. Also, a
    checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is maintained
    internally.
    * universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats:
          o atari/tos
          o djgpp2/coff
          o dos/com
          o dos/exe
          o dos/sys
          o linux/386
          o rtm32/pe
          o tmt/adam
          o watcom/le (supporting DOS4G, PMODE/W, DOS32a and CauseWay)
          o win32/pe

    * portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++

    * extendable: because of the class layout it's very easy to add new
    executable formats or new compression algorithms

    * free: UPX is distributed with full source code under the GNU General
    Public License, and may be used freely even with commercial programs.
