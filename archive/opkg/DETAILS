cat << EOF
Opkg is a lightweight package management system based on Ipkg.

It is written in C and resembles apt/dpkg in operation. It is intended for
use on embedded Linux devices and is used in this capacity in the OpenEmbedded
and OpenWrt projects.

As best it can, opkg maintains backwards compatibility with ipkg and conforms
to a subset of debian's policy manual regarding control files.
