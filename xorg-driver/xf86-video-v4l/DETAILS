cat << EOF
v4l  is  an  Xorg  driver  for video4linux cards.  It provides a Xvideo
extension port for video overlay.  Just add the driver  to  the  module
list  within  the  module section of your xorg.conf file if you want to
use it.  There are no config options.

Note that the the extmod module is also required for the Xvideo support
(and lots of other extensions too).

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The v4l driver works with every piece of hardware which is supported by
a video4linux (kernel-) device driver and is able to handle video over-
lay.

bt848/bt878-based TV cards are the most popular hardware these days.
