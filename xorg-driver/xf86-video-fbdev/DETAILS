           SHORT="fbdev  is an Xorg driver for framebuffer devices."
cat << EOF
fbdev  is an Xorg driver for framebuffer devices.  This is a non-accel-
erated driver, the following framebuffer depths are supported:  8,  15,
16,  24.   All  visual  types  are supported for depth 8, and TrueColor
visual is supported for the other  depths.   Multi-head  configurations
are supported.

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The  fbdev  driver  supports all hardware where a framebuffer driver is
available.  fbdev uses the os-specific submodule fbdevhw(4) to talk  to
the  kernel device driver.  Currently a fbdevhw module is available for
linux.
