cat << EOF
Tilde is a text editor for the console/terminal, which provides an intuitive
interface for people accustomed to GUI environments such as Gnome, KDE
and Windows. For example, the short-cut to copy the current selection is
Control-C, and to paste the previously copied text the short-cut Control-V can
be used. As another example, the File menu can be accessed by pressing Meta-F.

However, being a terminal-based program there are limitations. Not all
terminals provide sufficient information to the client programs to make
Tilde behave in the most intuitive way. When this is the case, Tilde provides
work-arounds which should be easy to work with.

The main audience for Tilde is users who normally work in GUI environments,
but sometimes require an editor for a console/terminal environment. This
may be because the computer in question is a server which does not provide
a GUI, or is accessed remotely over SSH. Tilde allows these users to edit
files without having to learn a completely new interface, such as vi or
Emacs do. A result of this choice is that Tilde will not provide all the
fancy features that Vim or Emacs provide, but only the most used features.
