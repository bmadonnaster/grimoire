* Multiple Selections
Multiple selections are the central way of interacting in Kakoune, with
powerful handling primitives (regex matches, filtering, splitting,
aligning, text objects etc).

* Customization
Users can extend the features of Kakoune or customize them to their liking with
macros or hooks.

* Text editing tools
Kakoune implements several tools to help editing/writing text: contextual help,
as-you-type completion, syntax highlighting for several programming languages.

* Client/Server architecture
With Kakoune, you can collaboratively edit the same file: all new windows
created by the editor are clients, and can simultaneously modify the content
of a file. As such, windows are fully under the control of your X11 window
manager or can be managed in a single terminal through Kakoune's tmux support.

* Advanced text manipulation primitives
Text can be selected and modified at will in multiple ways, thanks to several
primitives: selection rotation, case manipulation, indentation leveling.
