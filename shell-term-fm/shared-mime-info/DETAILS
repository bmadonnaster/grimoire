Many programs and desktops use the MIME system to represent the types of files.
Frequently, it is necessary to work out the correct MIME type for a file. This
is generally done by examining the file's name or contents, and looking up the
correct MIME type in a database.

For interoperability, it is useful for different programs to use the same
database so that different programs agree on the type of a file, and new rules
for determining the type apply to all programs. This specification attempts to
unify the type-guessing systems currently in use by GNOME, KDE and ROX. Only
the name-to-type and contents-to-type mappings are covered by this spec; other
MIME type information, such as the default handler for a particular type, or
the icon to use to display it in a file manager, are not covered since these
are a matter of style.

In addition, freedesktop.org provides a shared database in this format to avoid
inconsistencies between desktops. This database has been created by converting
the existing KDE and GNOME databases to the new format and merging them
together.
