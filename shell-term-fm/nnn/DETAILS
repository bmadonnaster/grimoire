cat << EOF
nnn is a fork of noice, a blazing-fast lightweight terminal file browser with
easy keyboard shortcuts for navigation, opening files and running tasks.

noice is developed considering terminal based systems. There is no config file
and mime associations are hard-coded. However, the incredible user-friendliness
and speed make it a perfect candidate for modern distros.

nnn works with the desktop opener, adds new navigation options,
navigate-as-you-type mode, enhanced DE integration, bookmarks, a disk usage
analyzer mode, comprehensive file details and much more. Add to that a huge
performance boost.
