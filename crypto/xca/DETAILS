This application is intended for creating and managing X.509 certificates,
certificate requests, private keys RSA and DSA. Everything that is needed for
a CA is implemented. All CAs can sign sub-CAs recursively. These certificate
chains are shown clearly. For an easy company-wide use there are customiseable
templates that can be used for certificate or request generation. All crypto
data is stored in a local portable file format.
