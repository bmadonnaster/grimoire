Freepass is a password manager based on the Master Password algorithm,
generates the same passwords as the Master Password apps, but also is capable
of generating Ed25519 digital signature keys for OpenSSH and signify, and
raw 256-bit keys for symmetric ciphers.

The generator settings (site names, counters) are stored in vault files,
and you can also store passwords and text in these (for stuff that can't
be generated).  You can merge two vault files (e.g. from sync conflicts),
and import KeePass 2 (kdbx) files.

It's written in the Rust programming language and uses libsodium as the
crypto library.
