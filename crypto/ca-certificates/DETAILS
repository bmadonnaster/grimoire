This package includes PEM files of CA certificates to allow SSL-based
applications to check for the authenticity of SSL connections.

It includes, among others, certificate authorities used by the Debian
infrastructure and those shipped with Mozilla's browsers.

Please note that certificate authorities whose certificates are included
in this package are not in any way audited for trustworthiness and RFC 3647
compliance, and that full responsibility to assess them belongs to the local
system administrator.
