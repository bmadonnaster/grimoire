Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy. With pass,
each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is the title
of the website or resource that requires the password. These encrypted files
may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied from computer
to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command line file
management utilities.

pass makes managing these individual password files extremely easy. All
passwords live in ~/.password-store, and pass provides some nice commands for
adding, editing, generating, and retrieving passwords. It is a very short
and simple shell script. It's capable of temporarily putting passwords on
your clipboard and tracking password changes using git.
