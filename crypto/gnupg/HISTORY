	* DEPENDS, UP_TRIGGERS: deprecate through a forced dependency such that
	  gnupg is not removed before gnupg-2.2 is being cast. If we don't do
	  this gnupg will be removed due to the self-conflict and only
	  afterwards are any dependencies of gnupg-2.2 (or potentially any
	  other spells) attempted to be cast, but they all fail as there is no
	  gpg to do the source verification (used for both source hashes and
	  pgp signature verification)

	* UP_TRIGGER: Need to trigger on an actual spell (gnupg-2.2) not provider (GNUPG)
