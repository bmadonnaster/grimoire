Engine_pkcs11 is an implementation of an engine for OpenSSL. It can be loaded
using code, config file or
command line and will pass any function call by openssl to a PKCS#11
module. Engine_pkcs11 is meant to be used
with smart cards and software for using smart cards in PKCS#11 format,
such as OpenSC. Originaly this engine
was a part of OpenSC, until OpenSC was split into several small projects
for improved flexibility.
