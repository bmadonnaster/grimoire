cat << EOF
pass import is a password store extension allowing you to import your password
database to a password store repository conveniently. It natively supports
import from 39 different password managers. More manager support can easily
be added.

Passwords are imported into the existing default password store, therefore
the password store must have been initialised before with pass init.

By default, pass imports entries at the root of the password store and only
keeps the main data (password, login, email, URL, group). This behaviour
can be changed using the provided options.

Pass import handles duplicates and is compatible with browserpass. It imports
OTP secret in a way that is compatible with pass-otp.
