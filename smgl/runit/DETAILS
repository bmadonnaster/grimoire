cat << EOF
runit is a collection of tools to provide system-wide service supervision and
to manage services. Contrary to sysv init, it not only cares about starting
and stopping services, but also supervises the service daemons while they
are running. Amongst other things, it provides a reliable interface to send
signals to service daemons without the need for pid-files, and a log facility
with automatic log file rotation and disk space limits.
