An operating system's success is inextricably linked with the number and
quality of applications that run on top of it. Linux and its variances between
distributions, however, present ISVs and individual developers with a unique
set of challenges: different distributions of Linux make use of different
versions of libraries, important files stored in different locations, and so
on. If an ISV wants to reach a global Linux audience, they must support more
than one distribution of Linux. These challenges and variances make it
difficult--and costly--for ISVs to target the Linux platform.

The Linux Standard Base was created to solve these challenges and lower the
overall costs of supporting the Linux platform. By reducing the differences
between individual Linux distributions, the LSB greatly reduces the costs
involved with porting applications to different distributions, as well as
lowers the cost and effort involved in after-market support of those
applications.
