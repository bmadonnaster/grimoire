	* DETAILS: Disable staged install (castfs), breaks with already existing
	  files under /var/ .

2009-11-26 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* INSTALL: Remove now trailing &&

2009-11-26 Andra≈æ "ruskie" Levstik <ruskie+f03a580f@codemages.net>
	* INSTALL: get rid of /usr/X11R6 - I think we can all agree that it's
	  not used anymore and that we should consider anything installing into
	  it a valid bug
	* DETAILS: update to 2.2.2

2008-10-10 Vlad Glagolev <stealth@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS: version bumped to 2.2.1; corrected short desc
	* INSTALL: don't install modules dir for X11 since mesalib and xorg-server
	  use dri one; create root's homedir only if the account doesn't exist

2007-10-13 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* INSTALL: fhs_mkdir already applies $INSTALL_ROOT
	  Use TRACK_ROOT, not INSTALL_ROOT, for symlinks (thanks Jaka)

2007-10-12 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* INSTALL: Fix symlinks relative to INSTALL_ROOT, otherwise you get
	  problems with broken symlinks as reported in Bug #13777
	  Need to make the /usr/X11R6/{lib,include} directories to create
	  symlinks under them and the directories we want to symlink to under
	  /usr also need to exist before symlinking
	  Fix X11 module locations (at least for DRI)

2007-05-06 Thomas Orgis <soukus@sourcemage.org>
	* INSTALL: ensure minimal passwd files with root:root
	  for possibly cast in yet-empty to-be chroot dir
	  That way, _every_ system account should be created by casts
	  instead of hand work.

2007-03-18 Thomas Orgis <soukus@sourcemage.org>
	* INSTALL: added creation of root and bin user (groups implied),
	  this could/should be removed when we have our account system reworked.
	  These two were not created anywhere before, just copied from iso.

2006-08-09 Thomas Orgis <soukus@sourcemage.org>
	* INSTALL: added creation of /proc and mail group

2006-07-08 Pol Vinogradov <vin.public@gmail.com>

	  permissions, games group is created here too

2005-12-29 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* INSTALL: create /var/run/utmp and /var/log/wtmp if they don't exist,
	  set them to group utmp and group writable, create group utmp

2005-09-16 Jeremy Blosser <jblosser-smgl@firinn.org>
	* INSTALL: Let fhs_mkdir() take full ownership arguments; change
	  /var/spool/mail to be created root.mail 3775.
	* DETAILS: Update UPDATED so people get the right permissions.

2005-09-15 Jeremy Blosser <jblosser-smgl@firinn.org>
	* INSTALL: Create /var/spool/mail before symlinking to it.  Make sure
	  /var/mail doesn't exist before trying to create a symlink.

2005-05-18 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* INSTALL: install /tmp with world write permissions and sticky bit,
	  use 'install' instead of mkdir + chown + chmod

2005-05-17 Arwed v. Merkatz <v.merkatz@gmx.net>
	* INSTALL: don't mkdir /var/mail and then later try to symlink it,
	  this leads to /var/mail/mail being a broken symlink

2005-05-13 Eric Sandall <sandalle@sourcemage.org>
	* DETAILS,PRE_BUILD,BUILD,INSTALL: Created
