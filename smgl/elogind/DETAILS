Elogind is the systemd project's "logind", extracted out to be a
standalone daemon.  It integrates with PAM to know the set of users
that are logged in to a system and whether they are logged in
graphically, on the console, or remotely.  Elogind exposes this
information via the standard org.freedesktop.login1 D-Bus interface,
as well as through the file system using systemd's standard
/run/systemd layout.
