A list of mirrors for various bigger hosts/projects. Users can pick one and
sorcery will use it when downloading, possibly speeding up the acquisition.

To add a new mirror list, just create a file with the mirrors, similar to
the existing ones, and add the default choice for that mirror to
config/defaults .
