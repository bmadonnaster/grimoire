cat << EOF
Bcache is a Linux kernel block layer cache. It allows one or more
fast disk drives such as flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) to
act as a cache for one or more slower hard disk drives.

This spell installs the tools to work with bcache devices, including
handling device creation and udev helpers/rules to get them online.
