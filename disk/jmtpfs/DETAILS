cat << EOF
jmtpfs is a FUSE and libmtp based filesystem for accessing MTP (Media Transfer
Protocol) devices. It was specifically designed for exchaning files between 
Linux (and Mac OS X) systems and newer Android devices that support MTP but not USB Mass 
Storage.

The goal is to create a well behaved filesystem, allowing tools like find and
rsync to work as expected. MTP file types are set automatically based on file
type detection using libmagic. Setting the file appears to be necessary for 
some Android apps, like  Gallery, to be able to find and use the files.
 
Since it is meant as an Android file transfer utility, and I don't have
any non-Android MTP devices to test with, playlists and other non-file
based data are not supported.
