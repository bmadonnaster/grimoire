Restic is a program that does backups right and was designed with the
following principles in mind:

  * Easy: Doing backups should be a frictionless process, otherwise you might
    be tempted to skip it. Restic should be easy to configure and use, so
    that, in the event of a data loss, you can just restore it. Likewise,
    restoring data should not be complicated.

  * Fast: Backing up your data with restic should only be limited by your
    network or hard disk bandwidth so that you can backup your files every day.
    Nobody does backups if it takes too much time. Restoring backups should
    only transfer data that is needed for the files that are to be restored,
    so that this process is also fast.

  * Verifiable: Much more important than backup is restore, so restic enables
    you to easily verify that all data can be restored.

  * Secure: Restic uses cryptography to guarantee confidentiality and integrity
    of your data. The location the backup data is stored is assumed not to
    be a trusted environment (e.g. a shared space where others like system
    administrators are able to access your backups). Restic is built to
    secure your data against such attackers.

  * Efficient: With the growth of data, additional snapshots should only take
    the storage of the actual increment. Even more, duplicate data should
    be de-duplicated before it is actually written to the storage back end
    to save precious backup space.
