NTFS-3G plugin for reading "system compressed" files.

System compression, also known as "Compact OS", is a Windows feature that allows 
rarely modified files to be compressed using the XPRESS or LZX compression formats. 
It is not built directly into NTFS but rather is implemented using reparse points. 
This feature appeared in Windows 10 and it appears that many Windows 10 systems have 
been using it by default.
