cat << EOF
This module tries to make install path resolution as easy as possible.

When you want to install a module, it needs to figure out where to install
things. The nutshell version of how this works is that default installation
locations are determined from ExtUtils::Config, and they may be individually
overridden by using the install_path attribute. An install_base attribute lets
you specify an alternative installation root like /home/foo and prefix does
something similar in a rather different (and more complicated) way. destdir
lets you specify a temporary installation directory like /tmp/install in
case you want to create bundled-up installable packages.
