cat << EOF
The YAML specification is huge. Really, really huge. It contains all the
functionality of XML, except with flexibility and choice, which makes it easier
to read, but with a formal specification that is more complex than XML.

The original pure-Perl implementation YAML costs just over 4 megabytes of
memory to load. Just like with Windows .ini files (3 meg to load) and CSS (3.5
meg to load) the situation is just asking for a YAML::Tiny module, an
incomplete but correct and usable subset of the functionality, in as little
code as possible.

Like the other ::Tiny modules, YAML::Tiny will have no non-core dependencies,
not require a compiler, and be back-compatible to at least perl 5.005_03, and
ideally 5.004.
