cat << EOF
This module provides code coverage metrics for Perl. Code coverage metrics
describe how thoroughly tests exercise code. By using Devel::Cover you can
discover areas of code not exercised by your tests and determine which tests
to create to increase coverage. Code coverage can be considered as an indirect
measure of quality.
