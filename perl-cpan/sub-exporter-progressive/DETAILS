Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties. This module is
a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your users just use Exporter if all
they are doing is picking exports, but use Sub::Exporter if your users try to
use Sub::Exporter's more advanced features features, like renaming exports,
if they try to use them.

Note that this module will export @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and %EXPORT_TAGS
package variables for Exporter to work. Additionally, if your package uses
advanced Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only ever
use Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.
