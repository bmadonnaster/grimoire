cat << EOF
This module is an extremely light-weight, high-performance Moose
replacement. It also avoids depending on any XS modules to allow
simple deployments. The name Moo is based on the idea that it
provides almost -but not quite- two thirds of Moose.

Unlike Mouse this module does not aim at full Moose compatibility.
