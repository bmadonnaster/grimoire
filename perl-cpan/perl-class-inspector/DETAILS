cat << EOF
Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most or
all of this information can be found in other ways, but they aren't always
very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level of Perl wizardry,
or strange and unusual looking code. Class::Inspector attempts to provide
an easier, more friendly interface to this information.
