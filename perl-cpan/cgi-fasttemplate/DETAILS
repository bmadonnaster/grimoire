cat << EOF
There are other templating modules on CPAN, what makes FastTemplate different?

CGI::FastTemplate has the following attributes:

Speed FastTemplate doesn't use eval, and parses with a single regular
expression.  It just does simple variable interpolation (i.e. there is no
logic that you can add to templates - you keep the logic in the code). That's
why it's has 'Fast' in it's name!

Efficiency FastTemplate functions accept and return references whenever
possible, which saves needless copying of arguments (hashes, scalars, etc).

Flexibility The API is robust and flexible, and allows you to build very
complex HTML documents or HTML interfaces. It is 100% perl and works on Unix
or NT. Also, it isn't restricted to building HTML documents -- it could be
used to build any ascii based document (e.g. postscript, XML, email).
