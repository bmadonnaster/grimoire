cat << EOF
Set::IntSpan manages sets of integers. It is optimized for sets that have
long runs of consecutive integers. These arise, for example, in .newsrc files,
which maintain lists of articles:

  alt.foo: 1-21,28,31 alt.bar: 1-14192,14194,14196-14221

A run of consecutive integers is also called a span.

Sets are stored internally in a run-length coded form. This provides for
both compact storage and efficient computation. In particular, set operations
can be performed directly on the encoded representation.

Set::IntSpan is designed to manage finite sets. However, it can also
represent some simple infinite sets, such as { x | x>n }. This allows
operations involving complements to be carried out consistently, without
having to worry about the actual value of INT_MAX on your machine.
