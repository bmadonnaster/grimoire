This archive contains the distribution Text-NumericData

It consists of some modules for parsing and working with files that contain
columns of numerical data in text files (ASCII, dat, txt, csv, tsv ... I
name them txd, for "TeXt numerical Data"). Those files occur as a flexible
human-readable format for exchange of small to intermediate data sets. As
such, they appear in rich variety and need some flexibility in programs that
work with them.

The main benefit of the package is the supplied set of tools to directly
work with these files, offering various operations like selection of subsets,
sorting, basic statistics and flexible computations (also involving auxillary
files influencing the main data set). Those operations are ideally combined
via pipelines constructed in the shell (a cross-platform GUI for building
filtering pipelines exists for an earlier version and might re-emerge if
demand is there).

The tools, starting with the prefix "txd", generally work as filters and
are designed to work on multiple files sent via Text::ASCIIPipe, to avoid
the penalty of recompiling the scripts all the time --- the raw parsing and
computing performance is secondary to that, for usual data sets. There are
some specific tools to convert from more esoteric formats. While there is
some general adaptivity in the parsing, this can be necessary to get the
data into an understandable shape.
