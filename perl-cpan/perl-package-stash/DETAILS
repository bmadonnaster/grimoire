cat << EOF
Manipulating stashes (Perl's symbol tables) is occasionally necessary,
but incredibly messy, and easy to get wrong. This module hides all of that
behind a simple API.

NOTE: Most methods in this class require a variable specification that includes
a sigil. If this sigil is absent, it is assumed to represent the IO slot.

Due to limitations in the typeglob API available to perl code, and to typeglob
manipulation in perl being quite slow, this module provides two implementations
- one in pure perl, and one using XS. The XS implementation is to be preferred
for most usages; the pure perl one is provided for cases where XS modules are
not a possibility. The current implementation in use can be set by setting
$ENV{PACKAGE_STASH_IMPLEMENTATION} or $Package::Stash::IMPLEMENTATION before
loading Package::Stash (with the environment variable taking precedence),
otherwise, it will use the XS implementation if possible, falling back to
the pure perl one.
