Test::Output provides a simple interface for testing output sent to STDOUT
or STDERR. A number of different utilities are included to try and be as
flexible as possible to the tester.

Originally this module was designed not to have external requirements,
however, the features provided by Sub::Exporter over what Exporter provides
is just to great to pass up.

Test::Output ties STDOUT and STDERR using Test::Output::Tie.
