cat << EOF
In general, your tests shouldn't produce warnings. This modules causes any
warnings to be captured and stored. It automatically adds an extra test that
will run when your script ends to check that there were no warnings. If there
were any warings, the test will give a "not ok" and diagnostics of where,
when and what the warning was, including a stack trace of what was going on
when the it occurred.
