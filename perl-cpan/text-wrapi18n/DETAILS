cat << EOF
This module intends to be a better Text::Wrap module. This module is needed to
support multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312,
and Big5. This module also supports characters with irregular widths, such as
combining characters (which occupy zero columns on terminal, like diacritical
marks in UTF-8) and fullwidth characters (which occupy two columns on terminal,
like most of east Asian characters). Also, minimal handling of languages which
doesn't use whitespaces between words (like Chinese and Japanese) is supported.

Like Text::Wrap, hyphenation and "kinsoku" processing are not supported,
to keep simplicity.

wrap(firstheader, nextheader, texts) is the main subroutine of Text::WrapI18N
module to execute the line wrapping. Input parameters and output data emulate
Text::Wrap. The texts have to be written in locale encoding.
