This module implements some sane defaults for Perl programs, as defined by two
typical (or not so typical - use your common sense) specimens of Perl coders. In
fact, after working out details on which warnings and strict modes to enable and
make fatal, we found that we (and our code written so far, and others) fully
agree on every option, even though we never used warnings before, so it seems
this module indeed reflects a "common" sense among some long-time Perl coders.

The basic philosophy behind the choices made in common::sense can be summarised
as: "enforcing strict policies to catch as many bugs as possible, while at the
same time, not limiting the expressive power available to the programmer".
