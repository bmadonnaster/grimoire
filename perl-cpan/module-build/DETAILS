cat << EOF
Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
modules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Developers
may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more
straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not require a make on
your system - most of the Module::Build code is pure-perl and written in a
very cross-platform way.
