cat << EOF
Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to associate
multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from the filename
of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as they have used
ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the distribution, which
results in a uniform name. But sadly not all uploads are created in this way.

CPAN::DistnameInfo uses heuristics that have been learnt by
http://search.cpan.org/ to extract the distribution name and version from
filenames and also report if the version is to be treated as a developer
release
