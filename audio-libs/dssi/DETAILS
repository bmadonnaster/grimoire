DSSI (pronounced "dizzy") is an API for audio processing plugins, particularly
useful for software synthesis plugins with user interfaces.

DSSI is an open and well-documented specification developed for use in Linux
audio applications, although portable to other platforms. It may be thought
of as LADSPA-for-instruments, or something comparable to VSTi.

DSSI consists of a C language API for use by plugins and hosts, based on the
LADSPA API, and an OSC (Open Sound Control) API for use in user interface
to host communications. The DSSI specification consists of an RFC which
describes the background for the proposal and defines the OSC part of the
specification, and a documented header file which defines the C API.
