Olivier Lapicque, author of ModPlug, which is arguably the best quality
MOD-playing software available, has placed his sound rendering code in
the public domain.  This library is based on that code.

NOTE TO FELLOW OPEN SOURCE PROGRAMMERS (from the README):
 "I (Kenton Varda) no longer have the time or desire to maintain this
  library. If anyone would like to take over for me, please e-mail me at
  <temporal@gauge3d.org>. Thanks."
