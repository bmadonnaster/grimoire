Lilv is a C library to make the use of LV2 plugins as simple as possible for applications. Lilv is the successor to SLV2, rewritten to be significantly faster and have minimal dependencies. It is stable, well-tested software (the included test suite covers over 90% of the code) in use by several applications.

Lilv is Free Software under an extremely liberal MIT-style license. It depends only on Serd and Sord, and is known to work on GNU/Linux, Free/Open BSD, Mac OS X, and Windows.
