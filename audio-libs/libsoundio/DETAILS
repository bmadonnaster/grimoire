libsoundio is a lightweight abstraction over various sound drivers. It
provides a well-documented API that operates consistently regardless of the
sound driver it connects to. It performs no buffering or processing on your
behalf; instead exposing the raw power of the underlying backend.

libsoundio is appropriate for games, music players, digital audio workstations,
and various utilities.

libsoundio is serious about robustness. It even handles out of memory
conditions correctly.
