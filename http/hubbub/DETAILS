Hubbub is an HTML5 compliant parsing library, written in C. It was
developed as part of the NetSurf project and is available for use
by other software under the MIT licence.

The HTML5 specification defines a parsing algorithm, based on the
behaviour of mainstream browsers, which provides instructions for
how to parse all markup, both valid and invalid. As a result,
Hubbub parses web content well.
