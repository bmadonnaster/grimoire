InspIRCd is a modular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server written in C++.

It was created from scratch to be stable, modern and lightweight. It
provides a tunable number of features through the use of an advanced but
well documented module system. By keeping core functionality to a minimum
we hope to increase the stability, security and speed of InspIRCd while also
making it customisable to the needs of many different users.
