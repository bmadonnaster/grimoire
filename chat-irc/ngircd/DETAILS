ngIRCd is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server
for small or private networks, developed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL); please see the file COPYING for licensing information.

The server is quite easy to configure, can handle dynamic IP addresses,
and optionally supports IDENT, IPv6 connections, SSL-protected links, and
PAM for user authentication as well as character set conversion for legacy
clients. The server has been written from scratch and is not based on the
"forefather", the daemon of the IRCNet.

The name ngIRCd means next-generation IRC daemon, which is a little bit
exaggerated: lightweight Internet Relay Chat server most probably would have
been a better name :-).
