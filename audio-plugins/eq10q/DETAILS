EQ10Q is an audio plugin bundle over the LV2 standard (http://lv2plug.in)
implementing a powerful and flexible parametric equalizer and more, take a
look in “Included Plugins” to get a complete idea of what is EQ10Q about.

All audio processing developed in this project is written in C language
and highly optimized focusing on DSP load reduction yet keeping a superb
audio quality, the audio engine is always working in 64 bits floating point
maths but interfacing with LV2 ports using the standard 32 bits numbers. We
believe that a good plugin is not completely useful without a full featured
graphical user interface (GUI) that provides the correct way to set it up. For
this reason, each plugin distributed in this bundle is supplied with a nice
GUI. These GUI’s are written in C++ and Gtkmm libraries to gain a great
control over the graphics.
