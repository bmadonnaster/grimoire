Dehydrated is a client for signing certificates with an ACME-server (e.g.
Let's Encrypt) implemented as a relatively simple bash-script.

This client supports both ACME v1 and the new ACME v2 including support for
wildcard certificates.

Current features:
- Signing of a list of domains
- Signing of a custom CSR
- Renewal if a certificate is about to expire or defined set of domains changed
- Certificate revocation
