cat << EOF
Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family.

Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded
into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and
iKerned by Igino Marini. In 2013 the Italics where added, and most recently â€” a
variable version.

It features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary
ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate
inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired
default character set.
