Google has been developing a font family called Noto, which aims to support all 
languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto is Google’s answer to tofu. The name 
noto is to convey the idea that Google’s goal is to see “no more tofu”. Noto has 
multiple styles and weights, and freely available to all.
