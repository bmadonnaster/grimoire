cat << EOF
League Gothic is a revival of an old classic, and one of our favorite typefaces,
Alternate Gothic #1. It was originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton for the
American Type Founders Company in 1903. The company went bankrupt in 1993, and
since the original typeface was created before 1923, the typeface is in the
public domain.

We decided to make our own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type
Movement. Thanks to a commission from the fine & patient folks over at WND.com,
itâ€™s been revised & updated with contributions from Micah Rich, Tyler Finck, and
Dannci, who contributed extra glyphs.
