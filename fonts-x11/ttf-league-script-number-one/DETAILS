This ain’t no Lucinda. League Script #1 is a modern, coquettish script font that
sits somewhere between your high school girlfriend’s love notes and handwritten
letters from the ’20s. Designed exclusively for the League of Moveable Type, it
includes ligatures and will act as the framework for future script designs.
