MonteCarlo is a bitmap font suitable for code editors. All the characters have
the same width, which is ideal for alignment. It is loosely derived from the
look of the Monaco screen font that was available on the old MacOS systems.

Some changes have been made to make it easier to differentiate certain symbols.
