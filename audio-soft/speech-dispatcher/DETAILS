cat << EOF
The goal of Speech Dispatcher project is to provide a high-level device
independent layer for speech synthesis through a simple, stable and well
documented interface.

Key features:

    * Common interface to different TTS engines
    * Handling concurrent synthesis requests  requests may come assynchronously
      from multiple sources within an application and/or from more different
      applications
    * Subsequent serialization, resolution of conflicts and priorities of
      incomming requests
    * Context switching  state is maintained for each client connection
      independently, event for connections from within one application
    * High-level client interfaces for popular programming languages
    * Common sound output handling  audio playback is handled by Speech
      Dispatcher rather than the TTS engine, since most engines have limited
      sound output capabilities 

What is a very high level GUI library to graphics, Speech Dispatcher is to
speech synthesis. The application neither needs to talk to the devices directly
nor to handle concurrent access, sound output and other tricky aspects of the
speech subsystem.
