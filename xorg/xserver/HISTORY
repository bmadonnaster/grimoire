	  this spell is still WIP. it currently installs to /opt/xorg and misses
	  *.pc files, so other software (drivers) cannot find stuff.
	  otherwise is appears to install the same files as the xorg-server spell
	  the overall build process is much faster
	  I have been building against mesa-18.x
	* PRE_BUILD patches: added, SourceMage specific patches
	* xwin-config.h.meson.in: add missing file

2017-09-30 Treeve Jelbert <treeve@sourcemage.org
	* DETAILS: version master (git)
	  an experimental rewrite of xorg-server using the meson build system
