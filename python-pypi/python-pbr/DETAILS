cat << EOF
PBR is a library that injects some useful and sensible default behaviors
into your setuptools run. It started off life as the chunks of code that
were copied between all of the OpenStack projects. Around the time that
OpenStack hit 18 different projects each with at least 3 active branches,
it seemed like a good time to make that code into a proper reusable library.

PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way to
run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's simple
and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've already
got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need PBR.
