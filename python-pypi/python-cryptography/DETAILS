cat << EOF
cryptography is a package which provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to
Python developers.

Our goal is for it to be your "cryptographic standard library".

cryptography includes both high level recipes, and low level interfaces to
common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests and
key derivation functions.
