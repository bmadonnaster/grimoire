cat << EOF
Scapy is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation program and
library.

It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them
on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more.

It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing,
unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it can replace hping, 85% of nmap,
arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, etc.). It also performs very
well at a lot of other specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like
sending invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics
(VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel, ...),
etc.
