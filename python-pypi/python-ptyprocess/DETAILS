Please enter a description of the spell here Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout
is not enough.There might be a password prompt that doesn 't read from stdin,
output that changes when it' s going to a pipe rather than a terminal, or
curses - style interfaces that rely on a terminal.If you need to automate these
things, running the process in a pseudo terminal(pty) is the answer.
