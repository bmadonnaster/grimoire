cat << EOF
This package provides python bindings for the LZ4 compression library.

The bindings provided in this package cover the frame format and the block
format specifications. The frame format bindings are the recommended ones
to use, as this guarantees interoperability with other implementations and
language bindings.

The API provided by the frame format bindings follows that of the LZMA, zlib,
gzip and bzip2 compression libraries which are provided with the Python
standard library. As such, these LZ4 bindings should provide a drop-in
alternative to the compression libraries shipped with Python. The package
provides context managers and file handler support.

The bindings drop the GIL when calling in to the underlying LZ4 library,
and is thread safe. An extensive test suite is included.
