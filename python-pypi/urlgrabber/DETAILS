cat << EOF
urlgrabber is a pure python package that drastically simplifies the fetching of
files. It is designed to be used in programs that need common (but not
necessarily simple) url-fetching features. It is extremely simple to drop into
an existing program and provides a clean interface to protocol-independent
file-access. Best of all, urlgrabber takes care of all those pesky
file-fetching details, and lets you focus on whatever it is that your program
is written to do!

urlgrabber came into existence as the part of yum that downloads rpms and
header files, but it quickly became clear that this is a general problem that
many applications must deal with.
