cat << EOF
A Python library for finding unresolved symbols in Python code, and the
corresponding imports.

The goal of this package is to be able to automatically manage imports in
Python. To that end it can:

  * Build an index of all known symbols in all packages.  * Find unresolved
  references in source, and resolve them against the index,
    effectively automating imports.
  * Automatically arrange imports according to PEP8.
