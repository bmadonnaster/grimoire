A simple program which checks Python source files for errors.

Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors. It works by parsing
the source file, not importing it, so it is safe to use on modules with side
effects. It's also much faster.

It is available on PyPI and it supports all active versions of Python from
2.5 to 3.4.
