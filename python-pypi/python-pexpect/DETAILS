cat << EOF
Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling
them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect works like
Don Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application
and control it as if a human were typing commands.

Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh,
ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup scripts for
duplicating software package installations on different servers. It can be
used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don Libes'
Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python.

The main features of Pexpect require the pty module in the Python standard
library, which is only available on Unix-like systems.
