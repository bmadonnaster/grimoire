cat << EOF
The setproctitle module allows a process to change its title (as displayed by
system tools such as ps and top).

Changing the title is mostly useful in multi-process systems, for example when
a master process is forked: changing the children's title allows to identify
the task each process is busy with. The technique is used by PostgreSQL and
the OpenSSH Server for example.

The procedure is hardly portable across different systems. PostgreSQL provides
a good multi-platform implementation: this module is a Python wrapper around
PostgreSQL code.
