cat << EOF
Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python, for human
beings.

Most existing Python modules for sending HTTP requests are extremely verbose and
cumbersome. Python's builtin urllib2 module provides most of the HTTP
capabilities you should need, but the API is thoroughly broken. It requires an
enormous amount of work (even method overrides) to perform the simplest of
tasks.

Things shouldn't be this way. Not in Python.
