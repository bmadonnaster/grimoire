Pylint is a python tool that checks if a module satisfies a coding standard.

Pylint is similar to PyChecker but offers more features, like checking
line-code's length, checking if variable names are well-formed according to your
coding standard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented, and
much more (see the complete check list).

The big advantage with Pylint is that it is highly configurable, customizable,
and you can easily write a small plugin to add a personal feature.

Pylint is shipped with Pyreverse which creates UML diagrams for python code.
