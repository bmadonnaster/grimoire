           SHORT="measures number of Terminal column cells of wide-character codes"
cat << EOF
This Library is mainly for those implementing a Terminal Emulator, or programs
that carefully produce output to be interpreted by one.

Problem Statement: When printed to the screen, the length of the string is
usually equal to the number of cells it occupies. However, there are categories
of characters that occupy 2 cells (full-wide), and others that occupy 0.

Solution: POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 conforming systems provide wcwidth(3)
and wcswidth(3) C functions of which this python moduleâ€™s functions precisely
copy. These functions return the number of cells a unicode string is expected to
occupy.
