Gertty is a console-based interface to the Gerrit Code Review system.

As compared to the web interface, the main advantages are:

  * Workflow -- the interface is designed to support a workflow similar to
    reading network news or mail. In particular, it is designed to deal with
    a large number of review requests across a large number of projects.
  * Offline Use -- Gertty syncs information about changes in subscribed
    projects to a local database and local git repos. All review operations
    are performed against that database and then synced back to Gerrit.
  * Speed -- user actions modify locally cached content and need not wait for
    server interaction.
  * Convenience -- because Gertty downloads all changes to local git repos, a
    single command instructs it to checkout a change into that repo for
    detailed examination or testing of larger changes.
