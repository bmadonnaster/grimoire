cat << EOF
Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure and
extend your application by discovering and loading extensions (“plugins”)
at runtime. Many applications implement their own library for doing this,
using __import__ or importlib. stevedore avoids creating yet another extension
mechanism by building on top of entry points. The code for managing entry
points tends to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager classes
for implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.
