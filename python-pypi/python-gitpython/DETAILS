cat << EOF
GitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories,
high-level like git-porcelain, or low-level like git-plumbing.

It provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data,
and additionally allows you to access the git repository more directly
using either a pure python implementation, or the faster, but more resource
intensive git command implementation.

The object database implementation is optimized for handling large quantities
of objects and large datasets, which is achieved by using low-level structures
and data streaming.
