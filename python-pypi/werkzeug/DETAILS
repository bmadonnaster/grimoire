Werkzeug started as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI
applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility modules. It
includes a powerful debugger, fully featured request and response objects,
HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control headers, HTTP dates,
cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL routing system and a bunch of
community contributed addon modules.
