Your terminal can display color, but most diff tools don't make good use of it.
By highlighting changes, icdiff can show you the differences between similar
files without getting in the way. This is especially helpful for identifying and
understanding small changes within existing lines.

Instead of trying to be a diff replacement for all circumstances, the goal of
icdiff is to be a tool you can reach for to get a better picture of what changed
when it's not immediately obvious from diff.
