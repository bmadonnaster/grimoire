Makes ANSI escape character sequences for producing colored terminal text and
cursor positioning work under MS Windows.

ANSI escape character sequences have long been used to produce colored terminal
text and cursor positioning on Unix and Macs. Colorama makes this work on
Windows, too, by wrapping stdout, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which
otherwise show up as gobbledygook in your output), and converting them into the
appropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other
platforms, Colorama does nothing.

Colorama also provides some shortcuts to help generate ANSI sequences but works
fine in conjunction with any other ANSI sequence generation library, such as
Termcolor (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor.)

This has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing
colored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing
applications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on
Linux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling colorama.init().
