cat << EOF
The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of python
source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse, pylint... Well, actually
the development of this library is essentialy governed by pylint's needs.

It rebuilds the abstract syntax tree created by the _ast or compiler.ast
module, using ASTNG nodes, and creates additional nodes by inspecting
living object.
