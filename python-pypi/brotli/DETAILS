Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a 
combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order 
context modeling, with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available 
general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with deflate but offers more 
dense compression.
