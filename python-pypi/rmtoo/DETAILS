rmtoo is a free and open source requirements management tool.

rmtoo uses a different approach than most other requirements management
tools: it comes as a command line tool which is optimized for handling
requirements. The power of rmtoo lies in the fact that the development
environment can handle the input and output files – there is no need for
a special tool set environment.

Example: if you need to handle baselines (and there often is), rmtoo can be
configured using a revision control system (e.g. git). The revision control
system can handle different revisions, baselining, tagging, branching and
many other things extremely well – there is no reason to reinvent the
wheel and making it less efficient.

Let one thing do one thing.
