cat << EOF
python-nss is a Python binding for NSS (Network Security Services) and NSPR
(Netscape Portable Runtime). NSS provides cryptography services supporting SSL,
TLS, PKI, PKIX, X509, PKCS*, etc. NSS is an alternative to OpenSSL and used
extensively by major software projects. NSS is FIPS-140 certified.

NSS is built upon NSPR because NSPR provides an abstraction of common operating
system services, particularly in the areas of networking and process management.

Python also provides an abstraction of common operating system services but
because NSS and NSPR are tightly bound python-nss exposes elements of NSPR.
