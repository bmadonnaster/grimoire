cat << EOF
It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software
such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
source code. Highlights are:

  * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
  * special attention is paid to details that increase highlighting quality
  * support for new languages and formats are added easily; most languages
    use a simple regex-based lexing mechanism
  * a number of output formats is available, among them HTML, RTF, LaTeX and
    ANSI sequences
  * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
  * ... and it highlights even Brainf*ck!
