           SHORT="utilities for converting from C/C++ include guards to #pragma once and back again"
cat << EOF
Include guards suck. They're tiring to type and tedious to update. Worse,
the task of updating boilerplate leaves room for copy/paste errors, or other
mistakes. #pragma once is simpler and less error prone. That's why you should
convert to #pragma once.

Alas, though #pragma once is available on all the most commonly used compilers,
it's not available on every compiler. Perhaps one day you'll add support
for a platform with a barebones compiler with no support for #pragma once
and you'll have to convert back. That's ok. It's easy!
