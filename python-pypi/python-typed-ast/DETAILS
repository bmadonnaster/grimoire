typed_ast is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and Python 3 parser
similar to the standard ast library. Unlike ast, the parsers in typed_ast
include PEP 484 type comments and are independent of the version of Python
under which they are run. The typed_ast parsers produce the standard Python
AST (plus type comments), and are both fast and correct, as they are based on
the CPython 2.7 and 3.7 parsers. typed_ast runs on CPython 3.5-3.8 on Linux,
OS X and Windows.
