cat << EOF
pyudev is a LGPL licensed, pure Python binding for libudev, the device and
hardware management and information library for Linux. It supports almost all
libudev functionality. You can enumerate devices, query device properties
and attributes or monitor devices, including asynchronous monitoring with
threads, or within the event loops of Qt, Glib or wxPython.

The binding supports CPython 3 and compatible versions of PyPy. It is tested
against udev 151 or newer, earlier versions of udev as found on dated Linux
systems may work, but are not officially supported.
