urllib3 is a powerful, sanity-friendly HTTP client for Python. Much of the
Python ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too. urllib3 brings
many critical features that are missing from the Python standard libraries:

 * Thread safety.  * Connection pooling.  * Client-side SSL/TLS verification.
 * File uploads with multipart encoding.  * Helpers for retrying requests
 and dealing with HTTP redirects.  * Support for gzip and deflate encoding.
 * Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.  * 100% test coverage.
