Ranger is a free console file manager that gives you greater flexibility and
a good overview of your files without having to leave your *nix console. It
visualizes the directory tree in two dimensions: the directory hierarchy on
one, lists of files on the other, with a preview to the right so you know
where you'll be going.

The default keys are similar to those of Vim, Emacs and Midnight Commander,
though Ranger is easily controllable with just the arrow keys or the mouse.

The program is written in Python and uses curses for the text-based user
interface.
