HTTPie (pronounced aych-tee-tee-pie) is a command line HTTP client. Its goal
is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. It
provides a simple http command that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests
using a simple and natural syntax, and displays colorized output. HTTPie can
be used for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers.
