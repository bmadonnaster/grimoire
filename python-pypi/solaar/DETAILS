Solaar is a Linux manager for many Logitech keyboards, mice, and trackpads
that connect wirelessly to a USB Unifying, Bolt, Lightspeed, or Nano receiver,
connect directly via a USB cable, or connect via Bluetooth. Solaar does not
work with peripherals from other companies.

Documentation here is for the current version of Solaar. Some Linux
distributions distribute old versions of Solaar. If you are using an old
version and something described here does not work you should upgrade using
one of the methods described below.

Solaar can be used as a GUI application or via its command-line interface. Both
interfaces are able to list the connected devices and show information about
each device, often including battery status. Solaar is able to pair and unpair
devices with receivers as supported by the device and receiver. Solaar can also
control some changeable settings of devices, such as scroll wheel direction
and function key behavior. Solaar keeps track of most of these settings on a
per-computer basis, because devices forget most settings when powered down,
and the GUI application restores them whenever a device connects. For more
information on how to use Solaar see the usage page, and for more information
on its capabilities see the capabilities page.
