Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in
a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command Line
Interface Creation Kit". It's highly configurable but comes with sensible
defaults out of the box.

It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun
while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement
an intended CLI API.
