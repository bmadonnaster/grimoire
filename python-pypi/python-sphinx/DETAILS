cat << EOF
Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
documentation. It was originally created for the new Python documentation,
and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of Python projects,
but C/C++ is already supported as well, and it is planned to add special
support for other languages as well.
