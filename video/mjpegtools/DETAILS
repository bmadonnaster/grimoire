The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos 
and playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression 
of audio and video under Linux. 

Recording is supported for the Zoran based cards like the Buz (Iomega), 
DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle), Matrox Marvel cards and the LML33 (Linux Media Labs). 
See related pages to the right to find the right driver for your card. 
The recorded videos can be converted to MPEG streams. The software playback 
of MPEG streams works with almost every player and every OS. 
You can produce special forms of MPEG streams like VCD (Video CD) and SVCD for 
hardware playback.
