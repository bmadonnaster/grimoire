KODI is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player
and entertainment hub for digital media. KODI is available for Linux, OSX,
Windows, and the original Xbox. Created in 2003 by a group of like minded
programmers, KODI is a non-profit project run and developed by volunteers
located around the world. More than 50 software developers have contributed
to KODI, and 100-plus translators have worked to expand its reach, making
it available in more than 30 languages.

While KODI functions very well as a standard media player application for
your computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion for your HTPC.
Supporting an almost endless range of remote controls, and combined with its
beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine, KODI feels very natural
to use from the couch and is the ideal solution for your home theater.

Currently KODI can be used to play almost all popular audio and video formats
around. It was designed for network playback, so you can stream your multimedia
from anywhere in the house or directly from the internet using practically any
protocol available. Use your media as-is: KODI can play CDs and DVDs directly
from the disk or image file, almost all popular archive formats from your
hard drive, and even files inside ZIP and RAR archives. It will even scan
all of your media and automatically create a personalized library complete
with box covers, descriptions, and fanart. There are playlist and slideshow
functions, a weather forecast feature and many audio visualizations. Once
installed, your computer will become a fully functional multimedia jukebox.
