PipeWire is a project that aims to greatly improve handling of audio and video under Linux. It aims to support the 
usecases currently handled by both PulseAudio and Jack and at the same time provide same level of powerful handling of 
Video input and output. It also introduces a security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from 
containerized applications easy, with supporting Flatpak applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and 
Flatpak we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block for the future of Linux application development.
