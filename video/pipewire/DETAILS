PipeWire is a project that aims to greatly improve handling of audio and video
under Linux. It aims to support the usecases currently handled by both
PulseAudio and Jack and at the same time provide same level of powerful handling
of Video input and output. It also introduces a security model that makes
interacting with audio and video devices from containerized releases easy, with
supporting Flatpak applications being the primary goal. Alongside Wayland and
Flatpak we expect PipeWire to provide a core building block for the future of
Linux application development.
