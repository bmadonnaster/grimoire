The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) was developed by the ISO/IEC Moving
Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG),
through their Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC). HEVC is
also known as ISO/IEC 23008-2 MPEG-H Part 2 and ITU-T H.265. HEVC provides
superior video quality and up to twice the data compression as the previous
standard (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC). HEVC can support 8K Ultra High Definition video,
with a picture size up to 8192x4320 pixels.
