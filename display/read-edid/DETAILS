read-edid is a pair of tools (originally by John Fremlin) for reading the EDID
from a monitor. It should work with most monitors made since 1996 (except for
newer ones with 256-byte EDID's - WiP), assuming the video card supports the
standard read commands (most do).read-edid is a set of two tools - get-edid,
which gets the raw edid information from the monitor, and parse-edid, which
turns the raw binary information into an XF86Config-compatible monitor section.

As of read-edid version 2.0.0, the lrmi code has been replaced by libx86 code
- same syntax, but allows for use on many more architectures. For powerpc,
there is a /proc interface, /proc/device-tree/pci/{video-card}/EDID, which
you can pipe to parse-edid. Some architectures, AFAIK, may be stuck with
only parse-edid.
