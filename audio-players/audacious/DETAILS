Audacious is an open source audio player. A descendant of XMMS, Audacious plays
your music how you want it, without stealing away your computer’s resources
from other tasks. Drag and drop folders and individual song files, search for
artists and albums in your entire music library, or create and edit your own
custom playlists. Listen to CD’s or stream music from the Internet. Tweak the
sound with the graphical equalizer or experiment with LADSPA effects. Enjoy the
modern GTK-themed interface or change things up with Winamp Classic skins. Use
the plugins included with Audacious to fetch lyrics for your music, to set an
alarm in the morning, and more.
