Audacity is a program that lets you manipulate digital audio waveforms.
In addition to letting you record sounds directly from within the
program, it imports many sound file formats, including WAV, AIFF, and
MP3. It supports all common editing operations such as Cut, Copy, and
Paste, plus it will mix tracks and let you apply plug-in effects to any
part of a sound. It also has a built-in amplitude envelope editor, a
customizable spectrogram mode and a frequency analysis window for audio
analysis applications.
