Aeolus is a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator that should be
good enough to make an organist enjoy playing it. It is a software synthesiser
optimised for this job, with possibly hundreds of controls for each stop,
that enable the user to "voice" his instrument.

Main features of the default instrument: three manuals and one pedal, five
different temperaments, variable tuning, MIDI control of course, stereo,
surround or Ambisonics output, flexible audio controls including a large
church reverb.

Aeolus is not very CPU-hungry, and should run without problems on a e.g. a
1GHz, 256Mb machine.
