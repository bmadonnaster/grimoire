FluidSynth is a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2
specifications. FluidSynth can read MIDI events from a MIDI input device and
render them to an audio device using SoundFont instruments. SoundFont files
are composed of digital audio "samples" and additional instrument parameters.
These files can be created or downloaded off the Internet. FluidSynth also has
support for controlling effects in real time and can play MIDI files.
Note: FluidSynth was previously called IIWU Synth.
