KXStitch is a program that lets you create cross stitch patterns and charts. Patterns can be created from scratch on a user 
defined size of grid, which can be enlarged or reduced in size as your pattern progresses. Alternatively you can import 
images from many graphics file formats which will allow you to reduce the number of colors and to restrict the conversion to 
full stitches or optionally use fractional stitches. You may also use images as backgrounds allowing you to trace over them. 
These imported images can then be modified using the supplied tools to produce your final design.
