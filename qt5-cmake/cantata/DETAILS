cat << EOF
antata is a Qt4/KDE4 client for the music player daemon (MPD). Originally
started as a fork of QtMPC, the code is now very different. Cantata can be
compiled with KDE support, or as a pure Qt4 application. The interface is
very configurable - most views can be shown as either a list or tree structure.
